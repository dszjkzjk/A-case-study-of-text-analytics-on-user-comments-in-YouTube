Here LG kills the competition. Its bad enough phones are getting rid of the headphone jack (and forcing either bluetooth or lightning/usb c - which all tend to have inferior DACs), so its refreshing that you not only find a jack but an actually decent on board ""hifi"" DAC that is comparable to an entry level external DAC/Amp setup."

Look, here's a company that will charge ridiculous prices for fancy looking boxes, while sealing everything up so tight there's no possibility to repair it and when you can, the parts you order are seized by customs (who WORKS WITH Apple) and your money is not refunded.  How about BRICKING YOUR PHONE IF YOU REPLACE A BUTTON?  How about continually including JTAG connectors in their laptops right in the very front of the board, giving the luser bountiful opportunities to short connections?  How about Apple ""repair ""technicians"""" blasting chips with hot air and calling it a job well done?  How about automatically pushing out unwanted updates?  How about not testing software enough to make sure when you call someone... YOU CAN'T HEAR THEM BEFORE THEY ANSWER?  How about monopolizing industry in developing nations, essentially forcing children to work in awful conditions for pennies per day?

Arrogance. 
Evil.

Ugx4zcYAcxEafZOD53N4AaABAg.8qgmq03EwV98qujKilXugZ,1 week ago,@henry29992 I drove for Uber. Picked up 10000 people in a year. Shiny Huawei tablet mounted on the dash so flush many thought it was built in. Many asked about it. Only one Chinese guy and one American had heard of Huawei. The Chinese guy liked the upcoming P20 at the time. The American had seen something of theirs at Best Buy but seemed to be trying to sound like he knew of them when he didn't. No one else knew anything of them who brought it up. They asked questions about the tablet and what it was and how I did split screen and I said it met my needs for Uber. That is a very large sample size....

Other down side would be the front camera's permanent beauty mode, might be the only one who kinda hates lol. other than that i love the big display. i bought this phone to make myself feel the luxury of having a top tier phone so it would motivate me to carry on studying hard and be successful in life. if u r reading this, have a great day and dont forget to get ur zinc, calcium, iron intake of the day :)"

When I had my iPhone 6 apple did the update to ruin the battery, when I went to have it replaced at the apple store they treated me terribly, I then paid out my contract which was $300, and got the iPhone 8, 4-5 months In i had nothing but problems with it and i had the warranty, i was taking it to apple every second weekend, and they wouldn't do anything about it. So I traded my iPhone 8 for a Samsung s8 plus, and I have not had a single problem since, there hasn't been a day i have regretted it. I cant even imagine using an iPhone again. I love the features of Samsung. The Samsung s6 has more and better features than the newest iPhone. 
Samsung had face ID for two years longer than apple, apple kept the same design from the iPhone 6/6plus to the 8/8plus, Samsung changes it every year. 
iPhone just got wireless charging as of the iPhone 8 and up, Samsung has had it since the Samsung s6. Android is the way to go. I will never go back to apple."

Sure Samsung has the best features in the market no company comes close but the lag just kills the brand. in all honesty this year I went with the IPhone XS Plus. This has to be the worst iPhone I???ve put my hands on. Not only does the phone overheats making the phone slow down & slugish. I expected this from Samsung never Apple I always told people want something glut fast & lag free go Apple well this year I truly can???t recommend this phone. Sure Apple it???s by far still the best video shooting phone but a trillion dollar company just trashed this year. My old iPhone 7 Plus isn???t only better but not once overheats note lags or crashes apps now that is a true completed phone.

UgxZ4CyGOCy_8sCtEqZ4AaABAg,3 weeks ago,"People who don't see the differences between iPhone Xs/Xs Max and other android flagships are either blind or just overhated. And before you start the war my friends, I have more phones than you do. Currently using the note 9 and Xs Max both maxed out, then I have the mate 20X, the Oneplus 6T, Xiaomi Mi mix 3, Asus Rog Phone, Razer phone 2, iPhone 8 plus, Vertu signature touch, note 8, s9/s9 plus. iPhone has a lot more advantages than android phones do that the haters never admit. First is the Xs/Xs Max has better refresh and response time. If you are a gamer, a 1ms response is always better than 5 or 10 ms. The touch feeling on the iPhone is way more superior compared to others, the response time is instantly, software update regularly and I experience no lag at all, rendering time is top notch and battery life is good except if you want to charge fast then put down more money. The note 9 is very good also, good camera, design and so on but poor battery life. I'm saying this because I have to charge my note 9 twice aday compared to the iPhone and the huawei mate 20X, and yup Samsung has the best oled display period but sadly it's 60hz and touchwiz UI is shit so games and apps are locked at 30 fps. The mate 20X is my third daily driver, it has a battery enough for me to hit 1.5 days easily, camera is the best I ever use and the kirin 980 in my opinion is better than the snap 845 in term of CPU performance. Then there is the overhyped Oneplus 6T. Yeah I get it you get a snap 845, 8gb of ram, 128/256gb of storage for a cheap price....and then what? Nothing else...because the oled display on the oneplus is poor quality, the bottom firing speaker is boring and out dated, the camera is supar and the customer service is FK horrible. Out of every phone I have Oneplus is the cheapest and the most horrible when it comes to customer service. The best one gotta go to Vertu, you hear that right. I could book restaurant and hotel in couple of mins with a real assistant but man the price is hella high. Then there comes Apple, I bought the Apple Care Plus with my Xs Max. My wife threw the phone against the wall making the display shatter. They replaced it with a new one for me in exactly under 5 mins. Samsung's partners came to my house to replace the back glass of my note 8 in a day and that's pretty good. So after everything, I think the iPhone Xs/Xs Max and the note 9 still are two of the best smartphone of the year and not the 6T (its my opinion). I don't want my phone die if I accidently drop it in the water, I also don't want to call the customer service from Oneplus. I don't care if Oneplus ask $1000 for it. Just make sure you take care of your customer before you pay for reviewers to say good shit about you Oneplus lol."

Some phones come with dongles (They aren???t THAT hard to use, just keep it with your headphones and it won???t be hard to lose) and you can also buy headphones that are made with a dongle like the apple headphones you can buy online that use the lightning port instead of the headphone jack. You can???t say that the Pixel 3 and 2, all iPhones since iPhone 7, and more are garbage. They aren???t garbage, they just don???t have a feature that you appreciate a lot."

So one would leave it plugged to your heaphones and it will always be there when you need it: problem solved! Buy a couple more dongles as needed... Or eventually buy straight USB-C audio headsets. 

And no ones ever talks about this, but with (usage) time and by their intrinsic design (too long inside the phone), 3.5mm jacks put enormous stress/strain on the phones' motherboards, they also often create an annoying hissing sound when you slide them in - which sometimes makes me wonder if there's isn't some sort of micro electrical shorting happening sometimes also causing software glitches... 

Anyhow, as sad as it is to see it go, it is really time in 2019 to kiss the 3.5 jack farewell."

Why there are no comparison of particular apps on Android and iOS devices on your channel?
For example, Soundcloud. Inside Soundcloud app on my newly bought Note 9 I want to copy link of a particular song. And I can't do that with few gestures. On my previous device , which is iPhone SE, I can do that very easily because there is such an option inside Share menu, called Copy. And on my $1K phone I don't have such an option.

WTF?, Marcues Brownlee? I don't think that phone that costs $1K can even have the possibility to be compared with other smartphones but you gave this device the first position. It can't be compared even with iPhone SE. small screen device.
Please, I highly recommend you to make videos that compare the real user experience on a phones but not cameras, display and other shit that is almost same from phone to phone.

Ugwx1zrQjmH_Cj_z21Z4AaABAg,3 weeks ago,My man.... I got my OnePlus 6t on Black Friday after having 7 Samsungs and two iPhones.. I truly want to say I hope I never go back this is the best phone I ever had in my entire life and that's including a couple of edge plus.the only thing that was hard getting used to was the completely different notification system but you learn things on the fly. When the first iPhone came out and when the first Galaxy came out no one knew what the hell they were either. I guarantee when people talk about future phones there's no longer two but now there's a big three.

UgzlGkrM70F2rcIYvnN4AaABAg,4 weeks ago,"LG G7 ThinQ didn't even get any awards? People be sleeping on LG, who's specs literally beat IPhone and other flagships everytime. Filming and taking pictures is fully customizabe; you can create gif's right from the phone; they always have the most megapixels; they have sooo many camera features, and other features like the ability to make apps Qslide apps. The G5 even has the multicam feature where you can use the front and back camera at the same time. They started the whole wide angle and 2 camera system, and will released a phone with 5 cameras. You can also record parts of the screen.

Even when YouTubers have seen me  use the LG phones, they're impressed- and I mean like Lachlan was impressed with the LG G5. 

Besides their amazing cameras, the first phone to have a 13 megapixel camera with their LG G2, they're just an  awesome phone brand that I think should be looked at more closely than even IPhone or Samsung.

I used it to vlog and film for YouTube, and still have my LG G6 and now am using the LG G7. They definitely improved since their G6, taking away the curved frame in their 2nd camera; adding the boombox feature; adding back the app drawer, and a better way to get to it; and, a bunch of other features. Their Qslide apps and improved AR features are awesome too. And like, so many other things."

UgzlGkrM70F2rcIYvnN4AaABAg.8q5ymT-fclQ8qYiHgs7C8X,2 weeks ago,"LG phones are literally worth shit. There is a reason after a month they go on sale and then stay at that sale price. There is a reason the unlocked g6 is $350 at Best buy while an unlocked s8 is still $450-600. There is a reason people don't buy them with their shitty UI, because it's awfully laggy, very soon after purchase. The g2 might have been a phone ahead of it's time, but the phone sucked. The g4 was the last good phone they made, and that is taking into account the shitty 808 and the screen problems, both happened to mine. The g5 was trash. The g6 was beaten handedly by my note 4 when I returned it to Tmobile and showed them that shit. The g7 I have literally seen one person holding since launch in the wild and they hated it. The v series is a scam for them to make more money by actually including specs and features that should have been released in the original. There is literally nothing I can still say positive about LG anymore....fucking nothing."

You can improve software, hardware, camera or battery, but the smartphone itself is fully developed now...

UgzOpQBW7YUHFC0M9Lx4AaABAg,1 month ago,"I recently ugraded from a Galaxy S7 Edge to OnePlus 6T 3 days ago, and so far I am loving it. 

OP 6T becoming MVP was a surprise for a lot of users who watched this video, as the phone had some serious caveats that were hard to get around with. No headphone jack (when a year ago they're mocking companies that do it), No wireless charging, No IP certification, and above-average (but not awesome) cameras, along side other features that make you shake your head in disbelief. 

However, when you consider everything else they've smacked into the device itself, you surprise yourself when asked about the price. 
OnePlus is no longer ""The Flagship Killer"" but instead continues to contest all the more expensive phones by putting top-of-the-line specs for nearly half the price. They now focused on providing great value for money whilst cutting as little corners as possible and is more customer-focused, providing the essentials the community wants while omitting those that they deem we can live without. 

This is why it is the MVP of 2018.

Awesome video, by the way!"

Oh it has a better camera than ur oneplus 6t as well. Sorry to break it to u but MP in phone cameras really dont mean shit unless you have a camera bellow 8MP. Things like the sensor and image processing are much more important. If the mate 20 pro has a 40MP camera and the pixel has a 12.2MP camera by your logic the mate 20 should absolutely crush the pixel 3's camera. Also, if camera megapixels are soo important, why the hell does a company like samsung put lower MP cameras in flagships like the note 9 compared to midrange phones?? Also to add on, the XR has better battery life, better speakers than the oneplus 6t and will get updated for a longer time. Yeah the display I know its obviously worse than the oneplus 6t's display but the Xr has many other advantages. The oneplus 6t charges faster, but it has a glass back yet no wireless charge.... Assuming u use the oneplus 6t you probably think wireless charging is the dumbest shit ever that is useless, but once a company like apple implements it in their phones it is everywhere. People in the tech community have multiple wireless charges, and so do I and I simply can not use a phone without it. It also has no ip rating. You probably dont care about that too and if you decide to write back you will say how ohh do u use ur phone in the shower no one needs an ip rating etc... I am not saying that the XR is much better than the oneplus 6t, both phones do some things better than the other but don't just assume that the oneplus 6t is the best possible phone at that price range.

There are phones with 12GB ram that suck. Second, I think I already said this but MP dont mean shit in phone cameras. U know which phone won best camera award - Pixel 3 and runner up - iPhone Xs. Yet both have lower MP than the op6t. I upgrade my phone every 3-4 years and I am willing to spend money if I know that what I get will last a long time. Its not called being a sheep its just called getting the best phone. If you take price out of consideration the note 9 is 100% a better phone than the op6t. And I am sorry but there are people who simply want the best. Mkbhd is the only significant youtuber who actually uses the op6t as his main phone. Go check videos where like 15 youtubers tell what phone they use as their main phone - none of them said op6t. They all picked note 9, mate 20 pro or the Xs Max.

UgyCnoYOWlPMPCvV_xR4AaABAg,1 month ago,"this is why i wont waste my money on phones anymore. The fingerprint sensor on the back was (and still is) perfect and you can unlock your phone while taking it out of the pocket. The bezels are only bad if it is oversized. The note 9 has the best movie watching while having big bezels. At this point phones are not getting any faster. My experience playing games on the s7 is about the same as playing on the note 9. At this point brands are making up any bullshit just so we give them $1000. We have reached a point were tech is not evolving as fast, so phone brands like samsung or computer brands like nvidia are making overpriced crap because they can't come up with new ways to make their products faster for the same price as old tech."

I have an iPhone X and I use it for general purposes, nothing more than calling and watching videos. It's just good for casual uses. But in terms of overall performance and specs, Oneplus 5t beats it in every way. It can also be used casually but I just save it for gaming purposes. The point is, iPhone is overrated and overpriced. For something you can can get double the amount of a phone that is actually better than it overall, it's definitely overrated."

UgxiEpdNtkRCKDstjcp4AaABAg.8pbrr4LsUfo8pyh-IuLHwr,1 month ago,"@Jan Tab Then explain how Fortnite completely reloaded on the Note 9 with hella more RAM over the Xs Max. Even the One Plus 6T is beaten in every category over the A12 chip in the XR/XS/XS Max phones. Just look at benchmarks. Even the iPhone X from 2017 beats the Snapdragon 845.  No water resistance or stereo sound, inferior processor and camera, no wireless charging, you really don't know what you're talking about and it clearly shows. They're not better specs, quite inferior in every single way. I'm not knocking the OnePlus phones, they're good but to call them better specs when they're worse is complete bs.

Also iOS also runs third part apps better like Snapchat which android can???t seem to figure out. The camera especially for videos is better. It can keep apps open way longer because of the efficiency even though it has less ram. It has 3D Touch, a whole new level of Face ID that other phones just don???t have. Water resistance.

UgxiEpdNtkRCKDstjcp4AaABAg.8pbrr4LsUfo8qaWsrFx1Qi,2 weeks ago,@Jake Felix apple isn't revolutionizing anything
UgxiEpdNtkRCKDstjcp4AaABAg.8pbrr4LsUfo8qasZrfKrYY,2 weeks ago,"@Jake Felix oneplus 5t literally beats iphone x on almost every task, speed and ram. only place it falls behind is 4k vodeo rendering"
UgxiEpdNtkRCKDstjcp4AaABAg.8pbrr4LsUfo8qbXcmSZdv7,2 weeks ago,kuubs do a geek bench and you???ll see that your third party android isn???t faster than ios
UgxiEpdNtkRCKDstjcp4AaABAg.8pbrr4LsUfo8qbXnIaePr4,2 weeks ago,IndoTurk Mapping you really gonna tell me they didn???t completely change the design last year. I agree with you all the the phone is a bit overpriced but it still in performance beats most of not all other manufacturers. The software optimized the phone to run smoother and faster.
UgxiEpdNtkRCKDstjcp4AaABAg.8pbrr4LsUfo8qbXslpCeLq,2 weeks ago,kuubs also probably not true but even if it was why are we talking about last gen phones and not the Xs and 6t
UgxiEpdNtkRCKDstjcp4AaABAg.8pbrr4LsUfo8qbYRJP9DKR,2 weeks ago,"IndoTurk Mapping when it comes down to it every phone has strengths and weaknesses. The iPhone has a faster operating system and a great video camera. The iPhone has a great software. Android phones are more customizable, and have more online apps available. iOS is more secure and safer, android has more options. iMessage is clearly better with its perks. iOS has less malware. But iPhones also cost 1000 dollars. Each phone has strengths and each phone has weaknesses. I believe the iPhone is better and faster and more optimized but that???s only an opinion. Like the phone you like, it???s not about what???s better they all are great and at different things but in the end it comes down to preference."
UgxiEpdNtkRCKDstjcp4AaABAg.8pbrr4LsUfo8qcFjxfqVRg,2 weeks ago,@Jake Felix I thought you wrote kebabs to a Greek bench?ï¿½ï¿
UgxiEpdNtkRCKDstjcp4AaABAg.8pbrr4LsUfo8qewnEW1SMp,2 weeks ago,@Ilyas Syed Yeah they don't suck but it's the little things that Apple does that makes a difference for example: No fast charger in the box and also the cables break easy
UgxiEpdNtkRCKDstjcp4AaABAg.8pbrr4LsUfo8r4_G5E_9mv,5 days ago,"What???s frustrating to me is that no tech YouTubers mention what the real value of the iPhone is, which is how it integrates with all the other Apple products. When you have an iPad, MacBook, Apple Watch, AirPods, HomePod Or any of the other Apple products, then hell yes the iPhone is worth $1000. The market for accessories is also much more developed for iPhones. That lifestyle and that ease and joy of using apples technology together is what makes the iPhone worth it. I understand you need to compare apples to apples (no pun intended) and a phone should be able to stand on its own. If I had no other Apple product in my life, and none of my friends had iPhones for me to use iMessage and airdrop, and if I was looking at the iPhone in a box without considering the rest of the world (like fair comparisons should do) then obviously no I wouldn???t buy an iPhone and obviously I could find better value. But the world isn???t black and white like that, and a products value can be increased by its interaction with other products."

My top two phones of. the year are the iPhone X Max because of the performance of IOS and the Huawei Mate Pro because of its battery and triple camera, even though it does run on Android. One on one tests have shown very little difference in performance between these two phones. By the way, Huawei's can be bought in places near the US so not having them available there is not a reason not to have one. As far as Huawei not being a friendly company, people say the same about Apple and Facebook, but continue using them. The struggle is all about 5G technology since China is more advanced stages than any US company. One last thing, in case you don't know, there is no competition between Samsung and Apple, since Apple owns Samsung. Nice review Marques."

UgxJiVKLR5N3nQo37sp4AaABAg.8pU0HnTmY3Y8qICw9eYs5J,3 weeks ago,"@Bell Times ok so listen. The phone is great. It's fast. I bought 8gb ram so obviously it's faster than 6 gb ram. Although it has high megapicel camera, it's not consistent. I clicked really beautiful pictures with rear camera but the front camera is somehow not that impressive coz it's so zoomed in and it's a let down during video calling. And the screen is really big but the The screen resolution is only upto 1080p so it's not that awesome display but its big and great to watch videos. Honestly I prefer the display details of s7 edge more over one plus 6t. The colors are little lighter and not so catchy to eyes. The battery is very impressive. It's full charge lasts more than nearly four s7 edge I believe. And that's my honest experience about it using it for 3 days."

But when I was nearing about the whole video, and I thought dude no mention of OnePlus 6T so far, this is bold.. but hold.. u awarded it the smartphone of the year award! Ideally it should have been crowned for the best budget handset, as that what it positions itself too.. basically just to include every known phone, u created some category or the other.. disappointing!
I'm a big fan of the OnePlus phones, but clearly u should not award the pinnacle category to a phone which doesn't have IP ratings, no wireless charging, no 3.5mm jack (though only Samsung provides only) and an average camera !
It should have been ideally some true flagship phone.. probably pixel 3xl.. yes it has its flaws too, but no phone is perfect.. OnePlus misses on too many fine points for the liking.."

Doesn't have best camera and video recording like pixel and iphone. Well headphone doesn't count much as other can still do same thing but at extra cost, others may not have sd card but you can buy with internal storage of up to 512GB again at cost, Xs Max ip68 so water proof. Well also, there is discussions that xs max has best screen than note9, note9 might have bright screen but bright doesn't mean best. I guess note9 can only be proud of the s pen only as others don't have it. And for those who don't have enough money for extras. So not the best but good value for money okay. And your note9 depreciates horribly, it's already cheaper than iphone 8plus. So it's worth to be bought a year after been released otherwise it's a loss to buy it after release"

You must think like a pro. Do not be stuck in the past, allow change to take over otherwise you will suffer emotionally. It is fact that the big 4000mAh  battery on note9 doesn't do good. Then good for you with your Huawei Lite that runs all day with 60% left....really what an idiot."

Well mate20pro may take good photos and battery is good too but video recording is so bad and doesnt even shoot 4k@60fps and it depreciate badly like Samsung, not worth it when trading in and software updates not good if you plan to keep in longer. Well note9 combines everything together and produces good results (camera and video recording less good than that of iphone xs/max). I would rather but iphone at high price and it will hold its value longer and trade it in at good value to get another IOS too phone, and not everyone will have it.

Might be smaller in its product range, but as someone who prefers a smaller phone in their hip pocket, 5.5in is not small, and 5.8in is too big. When I upgraded from my 4.7in Galaxy Alpha (mainly due to its lack of Band 28) I hesitated going over 5in, but I decided on a Huawei P9. At 5.2in this is probably just small enough to be comfortable with. Its a damn shame decently specced 5in and under phones have been abandoned."

He made the right choice with the 6T. I actualy find the Mate 20 pro a mixture of of gimmicks and eyefilling useless features. Its great and arguably the best all-rounder but most of the hype focuses on shit. I would actually consider the Note 9 just as good of an all-rounder but for me even better bc the pen is something I love and use a lot.

When it comes to camera the Mate 20 Pro is all specs. Not long ago MKBHD made a contest and people voted Pocophones camera for winner without knowing it. Both camera and Performance are something the average  consumer ( wich is like 95% of buyers) doesnt notice a difference from phone to phone. As for battery, great cause the bigger the better but as long as it lasts till the end of the day than there is no point in being bigger. Its only to cause idiots like you are atracted to big numbers and spcs that translate to nk major differences in real wold usage and gimmicks that only make the phone more expensive for no reason( like having both fps and face id which is just overkill). Its a no brainer that huawei is just throwing stuff at the wall and expecting them to stick.
On the other hand the average consumer DOES CARE FOR SECURITY and Huawei doesnt have great reputation on that matter.

If there was a best audio award it would have to go to the LG V40. 
 
 The V40 excels in every category of sound, from the amazing quality of its headphone jack to its ""boombox"" speaker, Bluetooth audio performance and incredible microphone recording quality. If you care about sound there's no phone that performs better across the board than the V40."

Where are the XPERIA series smartphones?

XPERIA is the only one with the best screens on smartphones with exclusive playback capabilities in Ultra HD 4K HDR above 60FPS (XZ2 PREMIUM), the XPERIA has the most of the best PPI screens on the market and the XPERIA XZ3 has its innovative P-LED screen being chosen by experts as the best O-LED screen in the world! The Xperia are the only Smartphones capable of recording videos in Ultra HD 4K HDR, they are the only ones with front stereo surround sound, they are the only ones with Dynamic Vibration System and they have their unique and innovative designers different from all that are practically more of them! Many features, more speed, many innovations and a lot of difference, besides being the only ones in the market capable of shooting in super slow motion 960FPS Full HD.

UgxKOoyH_XVeZUXfKex4AaABAg,1 month ago,"The Red Hydrogen One is definitely not for most people... more of a specialized device for those who really enjoy grabbing the cutting edge and helping to make it work better and lacerate less. Like the Red One camera, it is an evolving machine that gets better on nearly a weekly basis- and 99.9% of the population, like Marques, just want a phone that gets out of the way and works.

That said, the Red Hydrogen One is the only smartphone that was significant in any way this year (or the last 3 years?). If no other new phones had been released in 2018, it would have made pretty much zero difference to the user other than saving them a few bucks. The functionality of the Samsungs, Apples, Huaweis??et al are basically rounding error improvements over last years models and all of them would not be missed if they had never been. Other than the ""Red Media Machine"", which I reiterate is not for most people, not one of those other phones really justify their existence outside of an excuse to get people to buy a new phone they don't really need.

That was the devil's advocate, the angel's advocate would say that the incremental improvements add up over time and while 2017 to 2018 is insignificant, the 2015 to 2018 was worthwhile, as will be the 2017 to 2020."

Ugzp7klQusCLw7-jqAF4AaABAg.8pFVJkX2HLP8pXQJmjf1vw,1 month ago,"@David Buchanan LG is trashed tho they don't even update their phones. Remember that HTC U Ultra that got bashed early 2017 that phone even got updated to 8.0  Oreo faster than LG v20. I had the LG v20 when it first came out in October 2016 and all the way to August 2018, I was still on 7.0 nougat. I've heard that the LG v20 just a few months ago got the 8.0 update but by then I was already done with LG. The hTC U 11 and  12 are beast of smartphones there ain't nothing wrong with them smartphone and unlike LG, HTC actually is committed to updating their phones. With LG or samsung you got to wait damn near 6 months to a year or in my case two years before the v20 got an update. I didn't even get the 7.1 nougat update. I bought the LG v20 they talked it as the first phone on 7.0 nougat then it stayed on that until they finally updated it like in September or something by then I had got rid of it. I have an LG G6 as my backup phone it's okay but I rarely use it my main phone is my OnePlus 6t. Another thing LG does stupid things like you have the LG G4 with a 3000mah battery. Then when the LG G5 comes out you make the battery smaller 2,800mah battery with the LG G6 you put a 3,300mah battery in it then when LG come out with the LG G7 for some strange reason you go back to a 3000mah battery it literally makes no damn sense. That's what's keeping LG back just stupid stuff like that. There cameras are inconsistent they come up with a phone that got 3 cameras on it with this lg v40 and the cameras are okay at best meanwhile you got pixel who just got one damn camera and it blows out LG's cameras out of the water."

So really when people says oh note 9 got no notch. I was like whaaaaaaat? Yeah u r right it has notch, but it has such a big bezel compare to any phone in 2018 !!! Just can understand man. Why make this award looks so professional while it is full of subjective opinions.

But then... It build up for it.

OnePlus deserves it!
And Samsung, with the Note 9, deserves it too. After the Note 7 crisis, it was what Samsung needed to clean the plate. Note 8 had a crappy battery life.

Huawei - IMO - is a victim of USA drama against China. Trump is going hard on its opinion, not facts.
But Huawei has very good products, with medium software, with an excellent pricing. And Honor - a sub-brand of Huawei - takes it into a higher level, cutting corners where it should.

Marques, congratulations on your step up, since you finish college.
You are one of the Youtubers who deserves every $ you earn, as you live for this creative aspect of the platform. Thankfully - for me - it is tech :)

Adding the software differences between the 2 that go overwhelmingly to Note 9, the $250 difference is well justified. OnePlus 6t is a plain vanilla smartphone, like dry toast. Someone simply mention ONE item that the 6t is King of the Hill for and no other smartphone cannot do it (pocophone is half the price with same hardware specs). Price or no price difference, my note 9 has replaced my need to carry a laptop or tablet since August 2018. No other device can do that. Period!!!!"

UgzrqTfBQ0spKMdBPI14AaABAg,1 month ago,"All these phones are cool, but the fact is that no one buys them. Everyone I see on the street or actually know falls into one of three categories. The first and by far the most popular is just the iPhone user because iPhones are the best and easiest to use and understand for the average user. The second group is the Android user. Primarily using the S8 or S9, these people just don???t like Apple for whatever reason and have a Samsung flagship instead. The third and least popular group is the budget user. These people don???t buy Pocophones or anything, but usually the Samsung Galaxy J3. These are just people who pick up a crappy $200 Android smartphone and don???t really care about it as long as they can text and call people. I???d say about 99% of people I know are iPhone users, but I have one buddy who uses an S8 and another friend who uses a budget LG phone. Other than that, everyone I know has an iPhone and most people I see on the street or wherever who are using their phones have iPhones. I personally have an iPhone X and I love it and it totally makes sense that iPhones are the most popular by far, because they are undoubtedly the best for average consumers."

The Note 9 is clearly the most complete and best overall phone on the market.  When you compare the note 9 to the 6T it isn't even close. The  Note 9 has a better build, expanded memory, dual stereo speakers, a better display, better cameras, fast wireless charging, the s-pen, a bigger battery, tons of cool features, a headphone jack, no notch, a iris sensor, Samsung pay. Do I need to say more? What does the 6t has over the note 9? Faster charging, in display fingerprint scanner,  faster but unsecure facial unlock, a little faster a smooth software experience. Don't get me wrong. The oneplus 6t is a great device, but theres no way it's a better device than the note 9. I'm just saying."

For me for a cell phone to win their category they most have an SD card slot because I like to control my files and move them between my cell phones, tablets and laptops. For me best big phone is the Samsung Note 9, best small phone is the Samsung Galaxy S9, best picture phone is the LG G7 thinq with three cameras the regular camera, the telephoto camera, and the wide angle camera with an SD card slot, the Huawei Mate 20 is second with the same features with a nano expansion card( I prefer SD card). The google Pixel 3 one camera can't beat three cameras. for budget camera I am choosing the Samsung J7 with SD card slot that I own. For MVP or phone of the year I choose the expensive Samsung Note 9 over the affordable One Plus because of the One Plus doesn't have an SD card slot. Honorable mention to the Sony Experia XZ3. The top phone of the UK Stuff magazine are the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, OnePlus 6, Apple Iphone XS, Samsung Galaxy S9., Honor 9 Lite"

I always love how you somehow manage to be diplomatic towards the manufacturers, here by kind of everyone giving an award, but to though remain true, since giving Chinese phones good feedback is to me absolutely reasonable but it though requires kind of courage to do that in the middle of a trade war. And I think your excellence also shows in finally the best phone not also automatically being the most expensive phone! The price is a criterion, since not everybody can afford everything and I'm happy it also stayed a criterion for you!  Keep up the good work! ?ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿"

I think Note 9 or Mate 20 Pro should have won the final award because they're more complete smartphones than the 6T. Also, I think the Camera Award should have gone to the iPhone XS and XS Max because, unlike the competition, their cameras do not have any glaring weaknesses (very good still photos, best video and audio recording, very good front camera and probably the best and most consistent HDR). Pixel 3 has awful audio recording and no 4k 60 videos. Mate 20 Pro has a below-par front camera and no 4k 60 videos. Note 9's cameras are good but Samsung's image processing is a notch below that of Apple and Google."

I get saying it's the ""Best Camera"" but is it really when the Video is so bad? The video and photo taking to me go hand-in-hand.  I bought a Pixel 3 because of all the main reviews and almost immediately returned it because of how horrible the audio and video quality is - it's basically unusable compared to other smartphones - EVEN the Pixel 2 (Which I also had).  Anyways - that's my 2 cents into the endless sea."

Photos is only half of the camera and people seem to forget that when saying so and so is the best camera. It may be a notch below the pixel 3 but video wise it blows it out of the water and that should count for something as a overall package.

There was a time when 5"" phone were considered large. But now I think its time to limit the small phone size to 5"" range because we are used to that, the only factors that has changed are time and people's perception about these phone sizes. Our hand sizes haven't changed in this time, until and unless one has big enough hands you cannot operate a 5.8"" phone comfortably with one hand without a single issue or without complete reach on all corners and all functions without compromising the grip on the phone. Of course Palm phone has no performance to beat any competitors in the market. And yes the market of these phone sizes is small but MKBHD should consider that market. He never laid his eyes on the Xperia phones which makes decent enough compact phones to give a fair fight to Pixel 3 which is also somewhere in 5"" range."

And of course the Pixel wins the best camera award even if it doesn't have the best camera at all... Night shot is super cool, yes, but the video quality is shit and you literally have NO options in terms of wide angle or hardware based zoom, you can't even record 4K60 or 1080p240fps...

And what the hell did Razer improve? Almost NOTHING. Same Camera, still only 64GB, still bad cameras, same display, same specs overall and still no headphone jack. the only thing they changed was wireless charging and not even this was build in correct because the copper coil isn't placed in the center. This is seriously the most boring and useless upgrade ever. Even the iPhone XS was a bigger upgrade over the X...

UgzVD4eKLaVPhyJ--DJ4AaABAg.8p4libdGKIp8p5VXAYz4t3,1 month ago,"@Brian Koppa 
I was thinking the same.
The OP6T is definitely NOT the best phone, especially when the price is not that important.
The Razer 2 is the most useless ""upgrade"" ever. Even from the iPhone X to the XS you have more improvements...
And OF COURSE the Pixel wins the best camera award... I can guarantee you that the Pixel 4 also will win the award next year, no matter how good the competition is and how bad the Pixel is.

I wouldn't say Sony would win 3 awards but at least the best compact phone is literally made for Sonys compact series..."
UgzVD4eKLaVPhyJ--DJ4AaABAg.8p4libdGKIp8p5ag40hAFR,1 month ago,Ok. Maybe not 3 but definitely 2. They continually give the pixel 3 the best camera awards even though they buy the sensors from Sony. Definitely the most improved phone as well. Previous Sony flag ships were a joke unfortunately but this one really shines from its previous iteration.
UgzVD4eKLaVPhyJ--DJ4AaABAg.8p4libdGKIp8p5khxhSRQ2,1 month ago,"@Brian Koppa 
To be fair: It absolutely doesn't matter who is producing the hardware... Samsung also produces the displays for Apple but Apple is calibrating them themself. Same goes for cameras. Most manufacturer are using sony sensors but the results are sometimes pretty huge even if they are using the exact same sensors. Software has a huge impact. And this is where Sony failed all these years... 
But Google still shouldn't win thie award. It maybe is SLIGHTLY ahead in terms of normal pictures. But they have literally no options. No wide angle, no (hardware based) zoom, no 4K60, no 240fps in 1080p, not even 1080p60... And in video quality (which is also a huge part of a ""camera"") the Pixels are failing like no other."

Nah, die XZ3 is trash :D i had a lot time playing with this thing, starting at IFA 2018 and it's just not a good phone in my eyes. Or let's say it differently: It's not a good Sony phone. They lost simply everything that made an Sony phone a Sony phone in my opinion. The XZ3 is more like a Samsung phone with a Sony logo... ^^
But that's just my opinion. I simply liked the squarish design without huge curves a lot more than this Soap inspired design. And the fact that SONY removed the headphone jack also bothers me a lot. Sony was one of the companies I thought they will remove the headphone jack the last or never because they are so audio oriented...

And I also don't think Soyn will come pack with a ""bang"" in 2019... at least not a positive ""bang"" if you know what I mean.
The XZ4 is just too large. It's meant to be a phone sized ""in the middle"" between phablets and the compact series but they are killing this strategy with a freaking 6.5"" 21:9 display that made the XZ4 even taller than a Note9(!!) or XS Max(!!).
Sony is almost dead (on the Smartphone market), sorry. They won't come back with the release of a single phone. THAT'S something I can guarantee you... Especially when Sony still releases a phone every 6 months. That's too much but Sony does not understand this."

It's like if Hyundai released a luxury sport sedan that was a beast and undercut the competition significantly.  That won Motor Trend car of the year (Genesis G70).  

That's the things, all those allegedly better phones are only marginally so - battery capacity most will never need - extreme-low-light photography most will never use - IP rating which most will never care about - wireless charging rendered unnecessary by bigger batteries and fast charging.  and OP6/6T wins software experience hands-down (for Android anyway), and I think it wins ""prettiest""."

I know it's not the best phone out there, but the OnePlus 6 and 6T keep it simple and to the point.  The phones are freaking fast and do all the things that matter really well.  Like, speed, quick charging and battery life.  And the rest of the phone covers the rest of the bases enough to not be bothered by them.  Like the screen is plenty good.   But the best, is the near stock Android experience, quick updates and the Oxygen OS they put on top of Android is fantastic.  And if you don't like it, they don't force you to use it.

But i guess when you are internet famous, you can do what ever you want, you can do it really bad, but people will still like it because they consider you a good reviewer. Sorry but a thumbs down from me. Not in any way capable of giving out rewards when all you do is test top of the line Samsungs and Apples.

For the $600 increase in price over a well-spec'd OP6T, I get (a) a bigger battery (which I don't need because the OP6T has more than enough battery for my usage), (b) IP rating (which I don't need because I can't even imagine a scenario where I'd submerge my phone), (c) wireless charging (which again, between my car and bed charger, all set thanks), (d) low-light camera performance (I don't generally think to take photos in the dark), (e) wide-angle selfies.  (ok, that would be cool).

So I could have $600 in pocket, or a physically uglier phone that takes wide-angle selfies.  Then again, even if I were in a position where $600 was ""mere pocket change"", I'd probably still opt for 6T, because my company has black-listed Huawei devices from the corporate network.  And OP6T is Johnnie on the spot with the security patches."

Ugx7rYE-KBxHXc6VGf54AaABAg,1 month ago,"Utter crap! As a former OnePlus fan person, there is a big difference between hype and reality.  OnePlus phones are often overhyped to high heavens just like they are overclocked to give the illusion of speed. Their T versions are unoriginal rip-offs of whatever else comes out between their June release and November when the T is released. On paper OnePlus looks fine in reality their phones are crap with loads of software bugs and the need for constant updates. The OnePlus isn???t even a smart budget alternative. There are many better phones out there at the same price level. What has turned many old fans of the grand OPO from one plus is the constant marketing deceit used to lure customers to buy a beta phone in June and then releasing a  better tweaked version of the same phone in November. They also cheat in their benchmark scores and pay off reviewers etc. The Note 9 is a much better all round phone of the year even if it is more expensive - value for money doesn???t always equal cheapness."
Ugx7rYE-KBxHXc6VGf54AaABAg.8p3h11JG6Ch8p4tkZGnjVX,1 month ago,"huh?  I am an extremely happy OP6 owner.  I don't feel duped.  I got an enviable phone (seriously, it's not only as swift as the day I bought it, it's gorgeous, and have experienced no bugs that I'm aware of). I've yet to see a phone that makes me the least bit envious, especially for the price differences. in a year, who knows."

Ugx63A3SaXsZALXVinl4AaABAg,1 month ago,"Dear precious friend what are some practical ways you can remind yourself or others that Father God is in control and He is able?  Let me share a story with you........The repairman looked young?ï¿½?too young to fix our problem, a car that wouldn?ï¿½?t start. ?ï¿½?He?ï¿½?s just a kid,?ï¿½? my friend, Dan, whispered to me, showing his doubt. His disbelief in the young man sounded like the grumbling in Nazareth where citizens doubted who Jesus was.              

?ï¿½?Isn?ï¿½?t this the carpenter?ï¿½?s son??ï¿½? they asked (Matthew 13:55) when Jesus taught in the synagogue. Scoffing, they were surprised to hear that someone they knew was healing and teaching, and asked, ?ï¿½?Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers??ï¿½? (v. 54). Instead of trusting in Jesus, they were offended by the authority He displayed (vv. 15, 58).              

In this same way, we may struggle to trust in our Savior?ï¿½?s wisdom and power, especially in the familiar and ordinary details of our daily lives. Failingmay miss out on the wonder of His life transforming our own (v. 58).             

As my friend Dan found, the help he needed stood right in front of him. Finally agreeing to accept the young man?ï¿½?s aid, Dan allowed him to look at his old car?ï¿½?s battery. By switching just one bolt, the mechanic had the car running in seconds?ï¿½?engine humming and lights ablaze. ?ï¿½?It lit up like Christmas,?ï¿½? Dan said.              

So too may we expect and experience the Messiah bringing fresh light, life, and help into our daily journey with Him.  Begin your walk of faith in our Creator by first understanding that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Welcome Elohim (Father God) through Yeshua (Jesus Christ) into your life. Receive grace by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection. You will then be justified in salvation and forever blessed with love!  When I doubt You, Lord, help my unbelief.      

May God bless you in the Glorious name of Jesus Christ our Lo Savior.??????????????????"

The phone completely sucks for it's price, all it is good for is the night mode on the camera. And if you buy a phone just because of night photos you have a problem...After all, buy yourself a camera and don't have to deal with the unoptimized software and mediocre hardware."

No one, simply no one can justify a $1000 price point for a smartphone when the market is full of ""cheap phones are getting good"" and ""good phones are getting cheap"". I ain't starting any smartphones wars here, but just want to state that have a look at the market reality rather than being hoodwinked by Apple. No one denies their products aren't good or even best, they simply aren't worth the penny their greedy makers ask for. I see a poor fella here mentioning something about every smartphone maker copying the apple notch. They probably need to look at the options available in the market first than praise apple for that poorly implemented notch. The smartphone industry is already headed into a ""notchless"" future; while fine gentlemen like you appreciate apple for being outdated in terms of phone designs. ""Fast charging"" is a reality with companies like Huawei, samsung, oppo,  OnePlus, even small companies like xiaomi while for apple, you need to pay for anything additional you ask for. Price has always been a clear disadvantage for apple so far, but worthiness is definitely going to play a big role even for apple in the future. I won't be surprised to see apple making desperate moves to woo customers back. Reports are already there about poorest performance by Apple products this quarter. People seems to be finally ready for ""change""."

China is the next dominant power that has taken over the world. Chinese companies are innovating like anything while Apple is literally carrying over their outdated designs. A year is surprisingly long for technology to become outdated these days. Look at the designs of premium phones like oppo find X, OnePlus 6t, mi mix 3. All these Chinese brands have literally nailed it with designs for notchless displays. It's just a matter of time before apple tries desperately to compete with these future brands. Open your eyes and look around internet, you will find plenty of articles and videos predicting the future of apple. Apple is not dead now but it will surely be an underdog in the future if they don't change their strategies of inflating the prices by several hundred %. Using a brand name may work for a while but bleeding a consumer's pocket for the profits wouldn't continue for long."

UgzUwR-5wMgjfqV5L-Z4AaABAg,1 month ago,"I feel like as usual iPhone is favorited. Apple hasn't come out with a revolutionary device in a long time. Even their new phones have batteries way smaller than their price would suggest.
They are even uglier than they used to be and even more expensive with almost nothing new.

At least the iPhone 5 devices were actually very nice to hold in the hand. The new iPhones are just gaudy and useless.
Why the iPhone made it for cameras and not the Samsung S9 and Note 9, is beyond me. That adjustable shutter is leaps and bounds above anything Apple has.

 Then he mentions iPhone XR as having great battery life...um no. Sorry but iPhones have always been notorious for having minuscule batteries and this year is no exception.

 iPhone XS: 2,658 mAh
 iPhone XS Max: 3,174 mAh
 iPhone XR: 2,942 mAh
 
Regardless of whether or not they last a decent amount of time, they do not deserve any title for best battery of any kind.
He mentions the Red Hydrogen One as having the largest battery he's held, but there are phones with 10,000 mAh batteries. Yes they are very thick and unwieldy for most people but it saves having to have a phone and a battery pack as two separate items.

It really seems like MKBHD constantly is making excuses for iPhones and their absolutely terrible company that makes them.
Apple constantly tries to sue anyone and everyone who tries to fix one of their phones, only ever offers new features after every other major company has already come out with them, and then even tries to sue those companies, despite Samsung and Huaweii being first to the starting line with those technologies.

Apple constantly fails to bring new innovation, and constantly fails to stay relevant yet so many Apple fanboys and girls are completely oblivious to the fact that they still have two brand new devices under 3,000 mAh for their batteries.

Oh and they finally now add wireless charging when Samsung and many other companies have had that feature for many many years. They always try to pass off their ""new"" features as features only they have. They have been making phones since 2007 yet they are way behind other companies today.

LG, Samsung, Huaweii, Oppo, all are way ahead of Apple in EVERY SINGLE way. Yet Apple is still seen as relevant today. They are limited in what they can do, they limit the user constantly and yet people keep making excuses for Apple."

I used to work at a cellphone shop and owned tons of Androids. And iPhones have way less issues than androids. The amount of Android users that come in for issues doesn't match ios users. Pretty insecure comment he's not biased and he knows no one matches iPhones software and hardware compatibility. People like you used to come in the shop all the time and they would be humbled by the amount of Androids on repair compared to iPhones. So many of my Samsungs lagged and so many people I know left LG because of bootloops and went to ios. You probably only own one phone. I have iPhones, Samsungs, LG, Sony."

Don't know if it's the phones and/or the carriers, or both.    Either way......it's too much $$ to spend on a phone  ,  &  the monthly fees to run it .      Bottom line....   some genius decided we need to walk around with  a ""portable  computer"" that is nothing more than an extended invasion of  privacy.    Sadly ....we all fell for it . ...and keep falling for it  !    Some folks  will look to into  a basic  flip  ""cell phone"" to make  phone calls when traveling about.

UgwgVUcv_XeoP9txn654AaABAg,1 month ago,"have to disagree with the oneplus award. im a oneplus user, bought the oneplus one when it first came out, and when it got used up, i bought a oneplus 3t wich i still use today. those were both priced around ???350,- . since the beginning using oneplus, it had some shortcomings, like no wireless charging, no expandable memory, and no waterproofing. while im glad to see that they adressed the waterproofing. it came at the cost that it didnt have a headphone jack anymore, wich is a dealbreaker for me since i use my headphone around 4/5 hours per day. so it gained one feature, while it lost a way more important one. it would be a bummer if it stayed at that, but then they almost doubled the price, making it a close to ???700,- phone now. i am sorry to say but my next phone will not be a oneplus anymore."

The phone has got nothing special, compared to other flagships and if someone really wants to buy a phone with a great battery and takes this video as a judgment, he would be cheated for sure! This is the most terrible video I have watched from you, MKBHD and as a fan, I'm angry! Jonathan keeps being an iSheep and you're turning into a RedSheep! Good luck!

PS: Why spend $1200 on a shitty phone, even it has a better battery than most flagships? Leave even the iPhone XR or Huawei Mate 20 Pro. Even Pocophone F1 could be a really good choice or even phones from ASUS would be fine, where you spend $300 and spend $749 on an iPhone XR, and even after that, you will have enough money to book an Uber to go home!"

Too big to be considered a normal phone and to hold it like a normal person in your hand, but too small to be considered a tablet.

UgwJXUGkyZF98mXqVkZ4AaABAg,1 month ago,"(((((((DEMONS)))))))

Demons are another name for fallen angels who joined the kingdom of Satan in rebellion against God.

The origin of demons is not explicitly discussed in the bible. But the New Testament speaks of the fall and later imprisonment of a group of angels (1 Peter. 3:19-20; 2 Peter. 2:4; Jude 6). The group that participated in the fall apparently followed one of their own number, Satan. The fall occurred before God's creation of the world. In retaliatory hatred for God, Satan and his angels tirelessly seek to contaminate the human race with wickedness (Genesis. 3; Matthew. 25:41; Revelation. 12:9).

A symbolic view of this ""initial"" fall appears in Revelation 12:4 where the dragon (A symbol of Satan) ""drew a third of the stars of heaven"" (A symbol for fallen angels) and ""threw them to the earth."" Thus Satan has his own ""angels,"" who most students see as the demons of this era (Matthew 25:41; Revelation 12:9).

Because the Jews believed God's power was unlimited, the Old Testament contains little information about demons. The primitive status of the understanding of demons during this time is perhaps reflected in the way the Old Testament relates the fallen angels to God. It was a ""distressing [Or evil] spirit from God"" (Samuel 16:15-16 & 23) that brought great distress to Saul the king. It was a ""lying spirit"" from the Lord about whom Micaiah, the prophet of the Lord, spoke (1 King 22:21-23). In short, this is not to say God willed, but rather allowed the evil spirit to do its work.

The Bible reveals also that all pagan worship is a fountainhead of demon activity (Leviticus 17:7; Psalms 106:37). Demon function with greater freedom to work their bondage wherever human activities open to their ""worship""---that is, participate in carnal activities that disobey God's word, indulge the flesh, and cooperate with hell's agenda of sin, and self indulgence.??
(These sinful activities we engage ourselves in, gives the demons the authority to come into our vessels and cause turmoil in our lives. And Jesus uses these demons to try and make us use our freewill to seek him with all of our heart, soul, mind and strength).??
(Jesus): As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent. (Revelation 3:19).

The New Testament accepts the Old Testament teaching about Evil Spirits and advances the doctrine significantly. Demons are designated in a number of different ways in the New Testament. They are called ""Unclean Spirits"" (Matthew 10:1; Mark 6:7), ""Evil Spirits"" (Luke 7:21; Acts 19:12-13), ""Deceiving Spirits"" (1 Timothy 4:1), and a ""Spirit of Error"" (1 John 4:6).

The Bible warns against occult involvements, showing demon activity proliferates in such an evil spiritual environment. Luke describes one demon as a ""Spirit of Divination"" (Acts 16:16). Isaiah 8:19-22 and 47:9-15 clearly reinforce the danger-avoiding direction of Leviticus 17:7, in the spirit of the truth inherent in Deuteronomy 18:9-14 and 32:15-18. Paul clearly held this understanding (1 Corinthians 10:20-21) and warns against believers conceding any territory in their souls to the devil or his cohorts (Ephesians 4:25-32, see Verse 27).

A prime purpose of Jesus earthly ministry was to overcome the power of Satan. This included his conquest of the demonic realm (Matthew 12:25-29; Luke 11:17-22; John 12:31; 1 John 3:8). This explains the fierce conflict between Jesus and these evil spirits while he was on earth, and why Jesus promises his people---The Redeemed---authority over and power to cast out demons (Matthew 10:8; Mark 16:17).

Following the resurrection of Jesus and his return to heaven, these demonic principalities and powers have continued their warfare against those who are his followers (Roman 8:38-39; Ephesians 6:12). Yet Satan and his allies will finally be overthrown by God. After Christ returns, the devil and his angels will be defeated and thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone (Matthew 25:41; Revelation 20:10).??
This is a doom with which demons are quite familiar (Matthew 8:29).??
God will achieve the ultimate victory in this conflict which has been going on since the beginning of time."

And OP's value prop is strong enough to get people to question the value of any phone over $850."

So no, not worth to buying a phone for 1000??? if there are another phones that do the same for a cheaper price and they are still good quality. And talking about Samsung they don't update their phones as they should. So giving 1000??? for a phone I would not buy the note9 I would prefer an iPhone, it has updates for 4 years. And I could keep going because I might be older than you are. My first flagship was a Motorola the size of a brick and a screen smaller than a human finger.

So go ahead, pay Apple 1500 dollars for a smartphone that has no headphone jack, no fast charging out of the box, no extra featutes over older iphones.

So, Note 9 has a jack, fast charger, it could even be the best camera due to the fact that you can install the google camera, consider even the Manual mode, something good and useful. So Iphone doesn't have a fast charger, and it hasn't the universal usb type C. Even if Iphones have more updates, doesn't mean that they're better, there is not too much difference between them and even if a Note 9 won't be updated for 4 years it will have for sure more useful things like multitasking up to 2 or more apps, Samsung Dex, edge functions, AOD, changing screen res is useful, and generally a lot of options are given from the Software, and this happened in the past too. Note 9 also has expandable storage, i agree that Iphones have the best optimization and a more powerful chip but the OS is closed so you can't really use the chip, you can't install any apk or emulator, ps1, ps2, psp and so on."

And yes between iPhones and Samsung's I prefer iPhone, it is not only because of the updates. I am a tech enthusiast, not a fanboy. You clearly don't get the point. It's like me as a car tuner, I don't look for a car with heated seats, or little insonorisation. I rather have a bigger turbo, get it now? All those features you are talking about, most people do not even use them. Emulators, if you are a true gamer you will go for a console or a gaming pc. If you want to use two apps at the same time you use that on an iPad or a surfacebook,. Dex is a quite useful feature, but for me it is not, I always carry my mbp with me. Expandable storage it can be useful, but most phones have 128gb internal, that's enough I guess... The old jack... Well the old jack, I am not a world class musician so I am alright with my 3 pairs of wireless earphones/headphones, and I do own some type c earphones as well.

UgyHQln5QoEN00Rw8q14AaABAg.8p2HrYreAiR8p2PAYOaNOy,1 month ago,I'm not sure between the 6 and the 6T.  Is it better the fingerprint reader onscreen or is better at the back? and for those who have phones without headphone jack.. is it worth it?
UgyHQln5QoEN00Rw8q14AaABAg.8p2HrYreAiR8p2QjKj_VPZ,1 month ago,"@P??rez Q Personal preference. I like the snappiness of the on back fingerprint scanner.  As soon as I pick up my phone and touch the scanner on the back, the phone INSTANTLY turns on before I even look at the screen. Also, my fingers naturally gravitate towards that position on the back. There's also fingerprint gestures you can use on the OnePlus 6 that isn't available on the 6T. However, I don't use them at all. 

I think onscreen fingerprint scanner is pointless given how blazingly fast OnePlus's face ID is. As soon as I touch the power button or double tap the screen to wake the device, I'm already in the phone. ????????

In summary, the OnePlus 6's rear fingerprint scanner is my most prefered given I can quickly get into my phone in any position, whether that means the device is face down or face up. 

However, what made me not upgrade to the 6T wasn't the fingerprint scanner but the lack of a headphone jack. Even though I own a Sony WH-1000XM3, I like the flexibility to plug in when the BT headphone's battery dies. 

Again, it's all personal preference. You can't go wrong with either."

I'd say if you want bleeding-edge the and want to try the in screen fingerprint scanner and don't mind that it doesn't have headphone jack get the 6t.
 but if you would like a headphone jack and would prefer a faster physical fingerprint reader then get the normal 6.

I look at them as more like two sides of the same coin versus one thing replaced  the other. 

 having used the on-screen fingerprint scanner sometimes it does misread but it's not often enough that it really bothers me and personally I just think it's cool. but everything else is top-notch the phone is faster as long battery life it looks good.

 it's a OnePlus phone basically."

UgwrGKt5oxrMYDkTGkZ4AaABAg,1 month ago,"I have a pretty good question for you. Only because you shown in the past you have shown, you like two different phones. I have been waiting for almost a year for the pixel 3 to come out. Previously I have been a note (3,5,7,8) person. so when the opportunity came to buy the note 9. I turned it down. Cuz I was waiting on the pixel 3. Unfortunately I have only heard nothing but bad comments about the pixel 3. And since I have to work hard for my money. Would you still recommend the pixel 3? Or go for the note 9? Only because, I'm not looking at buying another phone for at least two years. And I run my business off my phone. I am a barber.
 Thank you for taking the time to read this. And responding. ???????? High rated for the third time. And I thought I did not give you clarity on my usage of a phone. 100% of the time I use voice to text. Like I'm using it right now. I take a lot of photos off my phone. Especially to show off my barber work. On Instagram under Charlesthebarber1. I also write papers off my phone. I also, do biblical detailed studies off my phone. So I'm not the average guy who just makes phone calls and sends emails. T-Mobile told me, I had over a hundred and twenty two apps on my phone. I expect my phone to make my life easier not harder. I work the snot out of my phone! So what you recommend will mean a lot.  Sorry this is so long. I just wanted you to be able to walk a mile in my shoes."

They'd love for you to buy a phone from them, and also buy some headphones. They want you in their eco system. Wireless is only superior in comfort.

A compact phone is one where a user can reach every part of the screen without shifting their grip, and for my medium-small hands that demands a body about the size of the XZ1C?ï¿½? 5""??2.6"" (129mm??65mm). Even with all the aspect ratio and notch stuff, the Pixel 3 is still 5.73""??2.69"" (146mm??68mm) and the iPhone XS is 5.65""??2.79"" (144mm??2.79mm), demanding almost another inch of reach.

Now, if you want to call the size of  these two devices medium or standard or regular, that's fine, but calling them compact 1) does not fall in line with branding, 2) does not reflect reality, 3) does not meet user expectation, and 4) deals an immense disservice to consumers of a phone category that no-one seems to want to build flagships for. Next year, have a compact group for phones <= 5"" effective size (including the screen and one side of the bezel since you only interact with one while one-handing), a big group for phones >= 6"" effective size, a mid-size group for everything else. Please."

Ugxi7q68SUhF1502CZp4AaABAg.8p267V2KdFn8p2XvrSkhy4,1 month ago,@Mr.Magnificent but this is a workaround not a solution. If I wanted a phone without a jack I think it'd be either a pixel or an iPhone 10S
Ugxi7q68SUhF1502CZp4AaABAg.8p267V2KdFn8p2ZRe0RiMb,1 month ago,"@Michael Janicki agreed! I got my 6 just before the 6t released but the specs were known. It really comes down to personal preference. While the on-screen fingerprint is very cool, i prefer the one in the back for that extra handiness and snappiness (hardly noticeable though) and the audio jack. With the fingerprint sensor on the back, i can actually add functionality to bind it to the notification pull down. Personally, i do not regret at all going for the 6 instead of the 6t"

Ugxi7q68SUhF1502CZp4AaABAg.8p267V2KdFn8qqqPV6ZC60,1 week ago,"@Essential EDM i know what a dac is, i call it digital as its a digital audio signal that leaves the phone to get processed and amplified in the dongle... and no they dont sound better, mostly its not the dac thats the problem but the amplification, which is limited by the space avaliable in these dongles.
(and no im not willing to carry a bulky external dac/amp with me)
A phone with proper audio components like the last iphones with a headphone jack or the latest lg and oneplus phones will always sound better.
And again, id want multiple inexpensive passive 1??? adapters on all of my 3.5mm headphones, not a single 20??? dac dongle always with me on the go that im likely to loose"

UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg,1 month ago,Giving the smartphone of the year to OnePlus 6t doesn't make sense. Sure it is so great for it's price and you could have given it the budget phone award. You shouldn't be considering price while choosing The Best Phone just like you didn't consider price for say the best camera phone . It should be given to the absolute best phone irrespective of the price for people who can afford it .  It looks like you wanted to satisfy all the fanboys by giving a award for each major company
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p28J0dUoRu,1 month ago,Dinesh Kumar Totally agree. He should have chosen Note 9 / Mate 20 pro / Iphone Xs max.
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p299NaRCrZ,1 month ago,Smartphone of the year means ALL aspects of the phone should be on point. OP 6t as said in the video is pretty good in all possible ways as well as the price. You can't just check off one of the criteria and say we shouldn't consider it. For me this award makes sense as the phone is literally amazing at everything.

UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2AkFiBDTM,1 month ago,@Marko Veljanovski $600 is flagship anything over $400 to me is flagship prices budget $0-$200 midrange $201-$400
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2BVb8l12c,1 month ago,"I guess you're right to an extent, but the OnePlus is better in many ways too. Such as, better HDR, faster speed, faster updates, arguably better design, faster charging etc. This is coming from an s9+ user."

UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2CD-mOiQt,1 month ago,"@MetalPhoenix45 my argument was not the features it was the cost they did used to be midrange when it was $400 with the 3t the year the one plus 3 and 3t where head to head with the axon 7 as big mid range phone but each year they have bumped prices up.
Personally I don't use all the features of a note 9 or one plus 6 to say the price is worth it but if you will use all the features then yes it is.
I just need a device that can play my games and last me a long time between charges so I go for 600 series phones with a 5000 mah battery."

UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2Du9vwJd-,1 month ago,So which phone is the smartphone of the year according to you?
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2DyiYN6YU,1 month ago,Rejoice Yadli The mvp isn't the normal person phone though. It is the mvp award the best phone of 2019 and it has nothing to do with price. And oneplus 6t is for sure not the best phone you can buy right now.
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2EHLvnLcx,1 month ago,"@Marko Veljanovski Well the Note 9 is steeply priced, although packed with features, same goes for the XS Max, overall a good phone all things is done well, but the price is steep, so it makes total sense the 6T won. I've got both the 6T and XS Max and both are amazing."
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2ElRhKuNg,1 month ago,"@Marko Veljanovski I get it, and what you say makes sense but I think what went to this as well for him seems to be the phone he just enjoys the most. He's always really disliked the Samsung software experience, and if you put the OnePlus OS on the note, I think that would be his winner. He talked about switching from his long time favorite of the pixel to the OnePlus, and I think there's just a lot OnePlus offers as an overall mvp. They've steadily improved in a lot of qualities and now offer 2 years of software support for all their phones. I think factors like that matter and contribute to why he may prefer the OP6T over the note."
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2F3loBA6_,1 month ago,"lets be honest..we all expecting it will be either mate 20 pro or note9.but considering his biased review of the mate 20 pro i was expecting the award goes to note9..which is also perfect i guess?but oneplus 6t??what? its not even cheap,have crap camera,so so battery,the only argument is the OS which is subjectively depends on preference. yeah! i agreed he tried to pleased all fanboy."

I get that the OP6T is faster but not enough to make it better than the Note 9. Samsung software got a lot better to the point where I don't miss being on Oxygen OS. Also the in screen fingerprint sensor is cool but not as dope as having an S-Pen if you ask me.
And the price? You can get an unlocked Note 9 for 700 bucks.

Edit: also Samsung DeX is great and you get a ton of accessories in the box. OP6T is cool and you might not care about all the extras, but why would you want less when you pick the best smartphone?"

Better battery is arguable, I get 9 hours of screen on time, I highly doubt you get that much on the OP6T. Better software is arguable too, I was thinking the same before getting the Note 9.

Here's my point : OP6T is a great phone (and one of my fav manufacturers), but the competition in the top of the line smartphone range is so brutal, that it is very hard to recommend a OP6 or 6T over a Note 9 or an S9 or a Pixel 3 non XL.

Moreover, the OP has lost some of its ground due to the introduction of Poco F1.
So the OP6T one of the very best? YES!

UgzYfNxk4pJWoc9jkY94AaABAg.8p1zxNV6mcJ8p28ZyPE6Id,1 month ago,"It's the best because it's the most balanced. For me, it's useless to have the best camera if the design sucks, to have the best design but a not so good battery life, or even to have good battery and camera but shitty, never updating and bloated software. Those are only hypotetical examples, I'm not speaking about any real device.

OnePlus 6T is the most balanced phone, not the absolute best in any category, but really good and high ranked in all of them. That makes it, regardless of the price, the best phone overall. I'm not on a budget and I could buy the Mate 20 Pro or the Note 9, but honestly... I simply prefer the OnePlus 6T, it's much more appealing for me."

There is no phone which is the absolute best in all categories, but OP6T is very good in all of them.That's really valuable for the average customer. I feel like I'm repeating myself, but you do look like you don't wanna understand: Being the best in one or two categories doesn't make a phone the best overall, another phone can be a little under that device in those two categories, but overall, as it is better balanced in the rest, be better for the average customer as a daily driver. 

Anyway, don't know what's the point of discussing this... These are the MKBHD Awards, he's the only juror, his opinion is the only thing it matters and... Do you know what?? He probably knows best cause he tested more phones than both you and me together and has 7.5 M subscribers for a reason."

UgxV8HJl67nt99yjQ6V4AaABAg,1 month ago,"I have to disagree with OnePlus 6T being receiving the award for best phone. I've been using it for 35 days now, and will continue to use it for at least 2 more years if not 3, and I could list an endless amount of faults it has. From the extremely poor camera performance, to the remarkably slow fingerprint sensor, I don't think I'd ever recommend the phone to anyone. It'd be easier to list just the good qualities it has, and that's easy because it's just two of them. The price and the battery. The 3700 mAh battery is durable and can sustain even the worst gaming habits. 
Don't think I'm some flagship snob either, my previous phone was a Nexus 5X. Don't want to be a debbie downer or anything, but those are just my personal experiences with the phone."

For me the main weak points were camera and fingerprint reader too I agree. But they are still very decent and the fingerprint readee improved drastically with the last software update. Not a perfect phone. But overall blazing good."

If we are talking about truly compact phones (5 inch display) of 2018 with the top notch specs - I would really consider this phone being a tough call for most of the  smartphones in a ""small/compact/tiny"" category. And I'm not even sure there is any flagships currently on the market with this size of the display. Still loved the video sooooo freaking much!)"

For a phone that every techtuber decried, it actually ended up being one of the best smartphones Apple has ever created.

And for everyone saying the screen sucks, go test one in store. Here's a hint: it's pretty freakin good."

UgzdrSJbEyl0vj0J9_54AaABAg.8p2ZE-nEB9u8p2dmmw2MWs,1 month ago,Stock android is garbage. Samsung UI has come a long way from S3 touchwiz. My ~3 year old S7 Edge is as fast as a brand new phone.
UgzdrSJbEyl0vj0J9_54AaABAg.8p2ZE-nEB9u8p2fRPzP5gQ,1 month ago,Stupid.
UgzdrSJbEyl0vj0J9_54AaABAg.8p2ZE-nEB9u8p2gJ3HG5uk,1 month ago,Sadly stock Android wouldn't have all the Samsung features built in. I do feel like they could make their UI more stock but at the moment it feels as smooth as butter. We'll see if time bogs it down

I had the S7 active before I got my OnePlus 6, and Oxygen OS is so much better in many ways, not to mention so much faster.

To all the People mocking Marques because Will Smith misspelled his name, Here are some things this guy did:

1) He is the Creator of the DECADE
2) He has 7.5M subscribers until now
3) Was called ""The best tech reviewer on the planet"" by Vic Gundotra

What have you done with your lives?

Are you seriously calling someone out for a mistake he didn't make and a typo?

P.S. What even is the point of the Note 9? It's made for people who didn't decide if they wanted a tablet or a phone so they literally picked the worst of both worlds. Too big to be considered a normal phone and to hold it like a normal person in your hand, but too small to be considered a tablet.

UgwJXUGkyZF98mXqVkZ4AaABAg,1 month ago,"(((((((DEMONS)))))))

Demons are another name for fallen angels who joined the kingdom of Satan in rebellion against God.

The origin of demons is not explicitly discussed in the bible. But the New Testament speaks of the fall and later imprisonment of a group of angels (1 Peter. 3:19-20; 2 Peter. 2:4; Jude 6). The group that participated in the fall apparently followed one of their own number, Satan. The fall occurred before God's creation of the world. In retaliatory hatred for God, Satan and his angels tirelessly seek to contaminate the human race with wickedness (Genesis. 3; Matthew. 25:41; Revelation. 12:9).

A symbolic view of this ""initial"" fall appears in Revelation 12:4 where the dragon (A symbol of Satan) ""drew a third of the stars of heaven"" (A symbol for fallen angels) and ""threw them to the earth."" Thus Satan has his own ""angels,"" who most students see as the demons of this era (Matthew 25:41; Revelation 12:9).

Because the Jews believed God's power was unlimited, the Old Testament contains little information about demons. The primitive status of the understanding of demons during this time is perhaps reflected in the way the Old Testament relates the fallen angels to God. It was a ""distressing [Or evil] spirit from God"" (Samuel 16:15-16 & 23) that brought great distress to Saul the king. It was a ""lying spirit"" from the Lord about whom Micaiah, the prophet of the Lord, spoke (1 King 22:21-23). In short, this is not to say God willed, but rather allowed the evil spirit to do its work.

The Bible reveals also that all pagan worship is a fountainhead of demon activity (Leviticus 17:7; Psalms 106:37). Demon function with greater freedom to work their bondage wherever human activities open to their ""worship""---that is, participate in carnal activities that disobey God's word, indulge the flesh, and cooperate with hell's agenda of sin, and self indulgence.??
(These sinful activities we engage ourselves in, gives the demons the authority to come into our vessels and cause turmoil in our lives. And Jesus uses these demons to try and make us use our freewill to seek him with all of our heart, soul, mind and strength).??
(Jesus): As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent. (Revelation 3:19).

The New Testament accepts the Old Testament teaching about Evil Spirits and advances the doctrine significantly. Demons are designated in a number of different ways in the New Testament. They are called ""Unclean Spirits"" (Matthew 10:1; Mark 6:7), ""Evil Spirits"" (Luke 7:21; Acts 19:12-13), ""Deceiving Spirits"" (1 Timothy 4:1), and a ""Spirit of Error"" (1 John 4:6).

The Bible warns against occult involvements, showing demon activity proliferates in such an evil spiritual environment. Luke describes one demon as a ""Spirit of Divination"" (Acts 16:16). Isaiah 8:19-22 and 47:9-15 clearly reinforce the danger-avoiding direction of Leviticus 17:7, in the spirit of the truth inherent in Deuteronomy 18:9-14 and 32:15-18. Paul clearly held this understanding (1 Corinthians 10:20-21) and warns against believers conceding any territory in their souls to the devil or his cohorts (Ephesians 4:25-32, see Verse 27).

A prime purpose of Jesus earthly ministry was to overcome the power of Satan. This included his conquest of the demonic realm (Matthew 12:25-29; Luke 11:17-22; John 12:31; 1 John 3:8). This explains the fierce conflict between Jesus and these evil spirits while he was on earth, and why Jesus promises his people---The Redeemed---authority over and power to cast out demons (Matthew 10:8; Mark 16:17).

Following the resurrection of Jesus and his return to heaven, these demonic principalities and powers have continued their warfare against those who are his followers (Roman 8:38-39; Ephesians 6:12). Yet Satan and his allies will finally be overthrown by God. After Christ returns, the devil and his angels will be defeated and thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone (Matthew 25:41; Revelation 20:10).??
This is a doom with which demons are quite familiar (Matthew 8:29).??
God will achieve the ultimate victory in this conflict which has been going on since the beginning of time."

Motor Trend car of the year was the (Hyundai) Genesis G70.  Shouldn't it some $500,000 Bentley, or $2M Ferarri, or whatever?  Not in their eyes.  And it makes sense.  The OP6/6T made a huge splash - they're amazing phones in their right, that also happened to be priced in such a way that call into question the value proposition of any phone over $800.  That's ""phone of the year"" not just the phone was the best ranking score in a bunch of categories (though I still feel OP6/6T is the best looking phone out there)."

So no, not worth to buying a phone for 1000??? if there are another phones that do the same for a cheaper price and they are still good quality. And talking about Samsung they don't update their phones as they should. So giving 1000??? for a phone I would not buy the note9 I would prefer an iPhone, it has updates for 4 years. And I could keep going because I might be older than you are. My first flagship was a Motorola the size of a brick and a screen smaller than a human finger.

So go ahead, pay Apple 1500 dollars for a smartphone that has no headphone jack, no fast charging out of the box, no extra featutes over older iphones.

So, Note 9 has a jack, fast charger, it could even be the best camera due to the fact that you can install the google camera, consider even the Manual mode, something good and useful. So Iphone doesn't have a fast charger, and it hasn't the universal usb type C. Even if Iphones have more updates, doesn't mean that they're better, there is not too much difference between them and even if a Note 9 won't be updated for 4 years it will have for sure more useful things like multitasking up to 2 or more apps, Samsung Dex, edge functions, AOD, changing screen res is useful, and generally a lot of options are given from the Software, and this happened in the past too. Note 9 also has expandable storage, i agree that Iphones have the best optimization and a more powerful chip but the OS is closed so you can't really use the chip, you can't install any apk or emulator, ps1, ps2, psp and so on."

It's like me as a car tuner, I don't look for a car with heated seats, or little insonorisation. I rather have a bigger turbo, get it now? All those features you are talking about, most people do not even use them. Emulators, if you are a true gamer you will go for a console or a gaming pc. If you want to use two apps at the same time you use that on an iPad or a surfacebook,. Dex is a quite useful feature, but for me it is not, I always carry my mbp with me. Expandable storage it can be useful, but most phones have 128gb internal, that's enough I guess... The old jack...

I got the LG power X 3 this summer because it was dirt cheap and had 4,500 mAh battery (the guy told me 6,000 mAh but whatev) I was working with a Galaxy s6 with about 2,500 mAh, I would have to charge it twice a day.

Now, I'm realizing my LG has great battery, but only 16GB storage (why would they go that low anyway) so I can't download apps... I put in an external 32GB microSD but that barely works :')

UgyHQln5QoEN00Rw8q14AaABAg.8p2HrYreAiR8p2QjKj_VPZ,1 month ago,"@P??rez Q Personal preference. I like the snappiness of the on back fingerprint scanner.  As soon as I pick up my phone and touch the scanner on the back, the phone INSTANTLY turns on before I even look at the screen. Also, my fingers naturally gravitate towards that position on the back. There's also fingerprint gestures you can use on the OnePlus 6 that isn't available on the 6T. However, I don't use them at all. 

I think onscreen fingerprint scanner is pointless given how blazingly fast OnePlus's face ID is. As soon as I touch the power button or double tap the screen to wake the device, I'm already in the phone. ????????

In summary, the OnePlus 6's rear fingerprint scanner is my most prefered given I can quickly get into my phone in any position, whether that means the device is face down or face up. 

However, what made me not upgrade to the 6T wasn't the fingerprint scanner but the lack of a headphone jack. Even though I own a Sony WH-1000XM3, I like the flexibility to plug in when the BT headphone's battery dies. 

Again, it's all personal preference. You can't go wrong with either."

I'd say if you want bleeding-edge the and want to try the in screen fingerprint scanner and don't mind that it doesn't have headphone jack get the 6t.
 but if you would like a headphone jack and would prefer a faster physical fingerprint reader then get the normal 6.

I look at them as more like two sides of the same coin versus one thing replaced  the other. 

 having used the on-screen fingerprint scanner sometimes it does misread but it's not often enough that it really bothers me and personally I just think it's cool. but everything else is top-notch the phone is faster as long battery life it looks good.

 it's a OnePlus phone basically."

I am officially unsubbing from your biased content that makes no sense. Last year you picked Note 8 as MVP yet you never used it. This year you're picking MVP phone that's not even sold in retailers, and it's a phone that doesn't compete with top guys, yet you use Pixel 3XL. You're a joke now, your content has zero credibility. It's a shame, because you were at one point the best reviewer on the planet. As soon as you became famous, you signed all these sponsor deals, you started taking bribes lol. Shame on you!!!!!"
UgwrGKt5oxrMYDkTGkZ4AaABAg,1 month ago,"I have a pretty good question for you. Only because you shown in the past you have shown, you like two different phones. I have been waiting for almost a year for the pixel 3 to come out. Previously I have been a note (3,5,7,8) person. so when the opportunity came to buy the note 9. I turned it down. Cuz I was waiting on the pixel 3. Unfortunately I have only heard nothing but bad comments about the pixel 3. And since I have to work hard for my money. Would you still recommend the pixel 3? Or go for the note 9? Only because, I'm not looking at buying another phone for at least two years. And I run my business off my phone. I am a barber.
 Thank you for taking the time to read this. And responding. ???????? High rated for the third time. And I thought I did not give you clarity on my usage of a phone. 100% of the time I use voice to text. Like I'm using it right now. I take a lot of photos off my phone. Especially to show off my barber work. On Instagram under Charlesthebarber1. I also write papers off my phone. I also, do biblical detailed studies off my phone. So I'm not the average guy who just makes phone calls and sends emails. T-Mobile told me, I had over a hundred and twenty two apps on my phone. I expect my phone to make my life easier not harder. I work the snot out of my phone! So what you recommend will mean a lot.  Sorry this is so long. I just wanted you to be able to walk a mile in my shoes."

UgzV3tPB42Gac-LTpQl4AaABAg.8p27IW2l9ON8p6TlGbcdGi,1 month ago,"I'm legit upset about this. A compact phone is one where a user can reach every part of the screen without shifting their grip, and for my medium-small hands that demands a body about the size of the XZ1C?ï¿½? 5""??2.6"" (129mm??65mm). Even with all the aspect ratio and notch stuff, the Pixel 3 is still 5.73""??2.69"" (146mm??68mm) and the iPhone XS is 5.65""??2.79"" (144mm??2.79mm), demanding almost another inch of reach.

Now, if you want to call the size of  these two devices medium or standard or regular, that's fine, but calling them compact 1) does not fall in line with branding, 2) does not reflect reality, 3) does not meet user expectation, and 4) deals an immense disservice to consumers of a phone category that no-one seems to want to build flagships for. Next year, have a compact group for phones <= 5"" effective size (including the screen and one side of the bezel since you only interact with one while one-handing), a big group for phones >= 6"" effective size, a mid-size group for everything else. Please."

While the on-screen fingerprint is very cool, i prefer the one in the back for that extra handiness and snappiness (hardly noticeable though) and the audio jack. With the fingerprint sensor on the back, i can actually add functionality to bind it to the notification pull down. Personally, i do not regret at all going for the 6 instead of the 6t"

(and no im not willing to carry a bulky external dac/amp with me)
A phone with proper audio components like the last iphones with a headphone jack or the latest lg and oneplus phones will always sound better.

UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg,1 month ago,Giving the smartphone of the year to OnePlus 6t doesn't make sense. Sure it is so great for it's price and you could have given it the budget phone award. You shouldn't be considering price while choosing The Best Phone just like you didn't consider price for say the best camera phone . It should be given to the absolute best phone irrespective of the price for people who can afford it .  It looks like you wanted to satisfy all the fanboys by giving a award for each major company
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p28J0dUoRu,1 month ago,Dinesh Kumar Totally agree. He should have chosen Note 9 / Mate 20 pro / Iphone Xs max.
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p299NaRCrZ,1 month ago,Smartphone of the year means ALL aspects of the phone should be on point. OP 6t as said in the video is pretty good in all possible ways as well as the price. You can't just check off one of the criteria and say we shouldn't consider it. For me this award makes sense as the phone is literally amazing at everything.
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p29odCACVM,1 month ago,Egozit But something like lets say the note 9 is better in EVERYTHING. Its not like the note 9 has something very horrible that makes it not receive mvp. The 6t is meh - good at everything but that still doesnt make it mvp as phones like mate 20 pro or note 9 Xs max are amazing in everything.

UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2AkFiBDTM,1 month ago,@Marko Veljanovski $600 is flagship anything over $400 to me is flagship prices budget $0-$200 midrange $201-$401
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2BVb8l12c,1 month ago,"I guess you're right to an extent, but the OnePlus is better in many ways too. Such as, better HDR, faster speed, faster updates, arguably better design, faster charging etc. This is coming from an s9+ user."
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2Bw_tUzdS,1 month ago,"Atif Ghafoor Still,  you cant consider price in an mvp award. He should have 2 different budget awards idk... But a phone like the 6t should for sure not be categorized as THE BEST phone of 2019 because its no where near the best."
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2CD-mOiQt,1 month ago,"@MetalPhoenix45 my argument was not the features it was the cost they did used to be midrange when it was $400 with the 3t the year the one plus 3 and 3t where head to head with the axon 7 as big mid range phone but each year they have bumped prices up.
Personally I don't use all the features of a note 9 or one plus 6 to say the price is worth it but if you will use all the features then yes it is.
I just need a device that can play my games and last me a long time between charges so I go for 600 series phones with a 5000 mah battery."
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2D_7ojX_g,1 month ago,"@John Emanuel they aren't, their os sucks and for the ""amazing additional features"" the note 9 has over the op6t, any normal person wouldn't give a fuck, but op at least has a better experience with the user and updates it's phones so fast beat only by the pixels, hope you enjoy your note 9 in the next two years when it's os is trash in comparison to samsungs latest offering while the op6t will still be receiving updates"

UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2DyiYN6YU,1 month ago,Rejoice Yadli The mvp isn't the normal person phone though. It is the mvp award the best phone of 2019 and it has nothing to do with price. And oneplus 6t is for sure not the best phone you can buy right now.
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2EHLvnLcx,1 month ago,"@Marko Veljanovski Well the Note 9 is steeply priced, although packed with features, same goes for the XS Max, overall a good phone all things is done well, but the price is steep, so it makes total sense the 6T won. I've got both the 6T and XS Max and both are amazing."
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2ElRhKuNg,1 month ago,"@Marko Veljanovski I get it, and what you say makes sense but I think what went to this as well for him seems to be the phone he just enjoys the most. He's always really disliked the Samsung software experience, and if you put the OnePlus OS on the note, I think that would be his winner. He talked about switching from his long time favorite of the pixel to the OnePlus, and I think there's just a lot OnePlus offers as an overall mvp. They've steadily improved in a lot of qualities and now offer 2 years of software support for all their phones. I think factors like that matter and contribute to why he may prefer the OP6T over the note."
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2F3loBA6_,1 month ago,"lets be honest..we all expecting it will be either mate 20 pro or note9.but considering his biased review of the mate 20 pro i was expecting the award goes to note9..which is also perfect i guess?but oneplus 6t??what? its not even cheap,have crap camera,so so battery,the only argument is the OS which is subjectively depends on preference. yeah! i agreed he tried to pleased all fanboy."

I get that the OP6T is faster but not enough to make it better than the Note 9. Samsung software got a lot better to the point where I don't miss being on Oxygen OS. Also the in screen fingerprint sensor is cool but not as dope as having an S-Pen if you ask me.
And the price? You can get an unlocked Note 9 for 700 bucks.

Edit: also Samsung DeX is great and you get a ton of accessories in the box. OP6T is cool and you might not care about all the extras, but why would you want less when you pick the best smartphone?"

Better battery is arguable, I get 9 hours of screen on time, I highly doubt you get that much on the OP6T. Better software is arguable too, I was thinking the same before getting the Note 9.

Here's my point : OP6T is a great phone (and one of my fav manufacturers), but the competition in the top of the line smartphone range is so brutal, that it is very hard to recommend a OP6 or 6T over a Note 9 or an S9 or a Pixel 3 non XL.

Moreover, the OP has lost some of its ground due to the introduction of Poco F1.
So the OP6T one of the very best? YES!
THE BEST? I'm afraid not."

Those are only hypotetical examples, I'm not speaking about any real device.

OnePlus 6T is the most balanced phone, not the absolute best in any category, but really good and high ranked in all of them. That makes it, regardless of the price, the best phone overall. I'm not on a budget and I could buy the Mate 20 Pro or the Note 9, but honestly... I simply prefer the OnePlus 6T, it's much more appealing for me."

UgzYfNxk4pJWoc9jkY94AaABAg.8p1zxNV6mcJ8p35bc1yhKQ,1 month ago,"@JOSE CARLOS CESPEDES Z. Again, it's the most balanced phone, that's objective. There is no phone which is the absolute best in all categories, but OP6T is very good in all of them.That's really valuable for the average customer. I feel like I'm repeating myself, but you do look like you don't wanna understand: Being the best in one or two categories doesn't make a phone the best overall, another phone can be a little under that device in those two categories, but overall, as it is better balanced in the rest, be better for the average customer as a daily driver. 

Anyway, don't know what's the point of discussing this... These are the MKBHD Awards, he's the only juror, his opinion is the only thing it matters and... Do you know what?? He probably knows best cause he tested more phones than both you and me together and has 7.5 M subscribers for a reason."

UgwoArUZI6SdVIPd5v54AaABAg,1 month ago,"I just diagree with only one categhory - and that is the smartphone of the year. 
For it's price the OnePlus 6T is one of the best phones you can buy, but if we leave the price behind, than it is not better than the iPhone XS or Galaxy Note 9 or Mate 20 pro....
I think next time you should choose the best phone, but not consider it's price. It would make much more sense.
Otherwise awesome video once again!"
UgwoArUZI6SdVIPd5v54AaABAg.8p1z5AvtLpG8p222yo3hy3,1 month ago,I disagree. Giving the MPV to OnePlus 6T is a way to register our complaint about the rise in flagship phone prices. It tells the manufacturers that we still do care about value per dollar.

I've been using it for 35 days now, and will continue to use it for at least 2 more years if not 3, and I could list an endless amount of faults it has. From the extremely poor camera performance, to the remarkably slow fingerprint sensor, I don't think I'd ever recommend the phone to anyone. It'd be easier to list just the good qualities it has, and that's easy because it's just two of them. The price and the battery. The 3700 mAh battery is durable and can sustain even the worst gaming habits. 
Don't think I'm some flagship snob either, my previous phone was a Nexus 5X. Don't want to be a debbie downer or anything, but those are just my personal experiences with the phone."

Ugw1P-J_3yy4d4xeeTF4AaABAg,1 month ago,"If you really want to give an award to a phone for battery life, I think it's more of a deal like battery capacity compared to your experience vs. the price tag. I can name at least 3 phones having capacities of 5000mAh. How the hell does Red Hydrogen One gets an honorable mention here, huh? The phone has got nothing special, compared to other flagships and if someone really wants to buy a phone with a great battery and takes this video as a judgment, he would be cheated for sure! This is the most terrible video I have watched from you, MKBHD and as a fan, I'm angry! Jonathan keeps being an iSheep and you're turning into a RedSheep! Good luck!

PS: Why spend $1200 on a shitty phone, even it has a better battery than most flagships? Leave even the iPhone XR or Huawei Mate 20 Pro. Even Pocophone F1 could be a really good choice or even phones from ASUS would be fine, where you spend $300 and spend $749 on an iPhone XR, and even after that, you will have enough money to book an Uber to go home!"

To all the People mocking Marques because Will Smith misspelled his name, Here are some things this guy did:

1) He is the Creator of the DECADE
2) He has 7.5M subscribers until now
3) Was called ""The best tech reviewer on the planet"" by Vic Gundotra

What have you done with your lives?

Too big to be considered a normal phone and to hold it like a normal person in your hand, but too small to be considered a tablet.

The origin of demons is not explicitly discussed in the bible. But the New Testament speaks of the fall and later imprisonment of a group of angels (1 Peter. 3:19-20; 2 Peter. 2:4; Jude 6). The group that participated in the fall apparently followed one of their own number, Satan. The fall occurred before God's creation of the world. In retaliatory hatred for God, Satan and his angels tirelessly seek to contaminate the human race with wickedness (Genesis. 3; Matthew. 25:41; Revelation. 12:9).

A symbolic view of this ""initial"" fall appears in Revelation 12:4 where the dragon (A symbol of Satan) ""drew a third of the stars of heaven"" (A symbol for fallen angels) and ""threw them to the earth."" Thus Satan has his own ""angels,"" who most students see as the demons of this era (Matthew 25:41; Revelation 12:9).

Because the Jews believed God's power was unlimited, the Old Testament contains little information about demons. The primitive status of the understanding of demons during this time is perhaps reflected in the way the Old Testament relates the fallen angels to God. It was a ""distressing [Or evil] spirit from God"" (Samuel 16:15-16 & 23) that brought great distress to Saul the king. It was a ""lying spirit"" from the Lord about whom Micaiah, the prophet of the Lord, spoke (1 King 22:21-23). In short, this is not to say God willed, but rather allowed the evil spirit to do its work.

The Bible reveals also that all pagan worship is a fountainhead of demon activity (Leviticus 17:7; Psalms 106:37). Demon function with greater freedom to work their bondage wherever human activities open to their ""worship""---that is, participate in carnal activities that disobey God's word, indulge the flesh, and cooperate with hell's agenda of sin, and self indulgence.??
(These sinful activities we engage ourselves in, gives the demons the authority to come into our vessels and cause turmoil in our lives. And Jesus uses these demons to try and make us use our freewill to seek him with all of our heart, soul, mind and strength).??
(Jesus): As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent. (Revelation 3:19).

The New Testament accepts the Old Testament teaching about Evil Spirits and advances the doctrine significantly. Demons are designated in a number of different ways in the New Testament. They are called ""Unclean Spirits"" (Matthew 10:1; Mark 6:7), ""Evil Spirits"" (Luke 7:21; Acts 19:12-13), ""Deceiving Spirits"" (1 Timothy 4:1), and a ""Spirit of Error"" (1 John 4:6).

The Bible warns against occult involvements, showing demon activity proliferates in such an evil spiritual environment. Luke describes one demon as a ""Spirit of Divination"" (Acts 16:16). Isaiah 8:19-22 and 47:9-15 clearly reinforce the danger-avoiding direction of Leviticus 17:7, in the spirit of the truth inherent in Deuteronomy 18:9-14 and 32:15-18. Paul clearly held this understanding (1 Corinthians 10:20-21) and warns against believers conceding any territory in their souls to the devil or his cohorts (Ephesians 4:25-32, see Verse 27).

A prime purpose of Jesus earthly ministry was to overcome the power of Satan. This included his conquest of the demonic realm (Matthew 12:25-29; Luke 11:17-22; John 12:31; 1 John 3:8). This explains the fierce conflict between Jesus and these evil spirits while he was on earth, and why Jesus promises his people---The Redeemed---authority over and power to cast out demons (Matthew 10:8; Mark 16:17).

Following the resurrection of Jesus and his return to heaven, these demonic principalities and powers have continued their warfare against those who are his followers (Roman 8:38-39; Ephesians 6:12). Yet Satan and his allies will finally be overthrown by God. After Christ returns, the devil and his angels will be defeated and thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone (Matthew 25:41; Revelation 20:10).??
This is a doom with which demons are quite familiar (Matthew 8:29).??
God will achieve the ultimate victory in this conflict which has been going on since the beginning of time."

Motor Trend car of the year was the (Hyundai) Genesis G70.  Shouldn't it some $500,000 Bentley, or $2M Ferarri, or whatever?  Not in their eyes.  And it makes sense.  The OP6/6T made a huge splash - they're amazing phones in their right, that also happened to be priced in such a way that call into question the value proposition of any phone over $800.  That's ""phone of the year"" not just the phone was the best ranking score in a bunch of categories (though I still feel OP6/6T is the best looking phone out there)."

UgxdOkEImPgNXNtC6C94AaABAg.8p2O9k8N6hE8p2sr8i8N3t,1 month ago,"@Andr?? Filipe Lol are you kidding me? You'd prefer buying an Iphone just because it updates for more years? I'm ok with saying that OP6T is close to the Note 9, but Iphone, meh IMO.
So, Note 9 has a jack, fast charger, it could even be the best camera due to the fact that you can install the google camera, consider even the Manual mode, something good and useful. So Iphone doesn't have a fast charger, and it hasn't the universal usb type C. Even if Iphones have more updates, doesn't mean that they're better, there is not too much difference between them and even if a Note 9 won't be updated for 4 years it will have for sure more useful things like multitasking up to 2 or more apps, Samsung Dex, edge functions, AOD, changing screen res is useful, and generally a lot of options are given from the Software, and this happened in the past too. Note 9 also has expandable storage, i agree that Iphones have the best optimization and a more powerful chip but the OS is closed so you can't really use the chip, you can't install any apk or emulator, ps1, ps2, psp and so on."
UgxdOkEImPgNXNtC6C94AaABAg.8p2O9k8N6hE8p2vSjmZF-e,1 month ago,"@??LyCr4p ' iPhones are pretty good devices. The only things I hate about Samsung is the UI and the lack of software updates, apart from that they are awesome devices. And yes between iPhones and Samsung's I prefer iPhone, it is not only because of the updates. I am a tech enthusiast, not a fanboy. You clearly don't get the point. It's like me as a car tuner, I don't look for a car with heated seats, or little insonorisation. I rather have a bigger turbo, get it now? All those features you are talking about, most people do not even use them. Emulators, if you are a true gamer you will go for a console or a gaming pc. If you want to use two apps at the same time you use that on an iPad or a surfacebook,. Dex is a quite useful feature, but for me it is not, I always carry my mbp with me. Expandable storage it can be useful, but most phones have 128gb internal, that's enough I guess... The old jack... Well the old jack, I am not a world class musician so I am alright with my 3 pairs of wireless earphones/headphones, and I do own some type c earphones as well. The spen, well not gonna trade it for my ""real"" pen, really like my paper notes. So yeah the note has a lot of features... But do you really use them? Is it that worth spending that much so you can showoff gimmicky stuff?"
UgxdOkEImPgNXNtC6C94AaABAg.8p2O9k8N6hE8p2wczs9-1l,1 month ago,"@Andr?? Filipe There is some misunderstanding. In the previous comment you said ""If I had to pay 1000$ I would buy an Apple over a Samsung"", and in this one you said that you prefer Samsungs over iphones.. I don't understand this

Edit: Samsung has a reason for their pricing, while apple? Idk, they aren't even totally honest, air pods at 150$ what the heck is this? Also they haven't any original fast charger, and it's not a good thing, I mean, all that price and you don't include a decent charger and not a stupid cheap ass cable that breaks after 3 months?!"

Now, I'm realizing my LG has great battery, but only 16GB storage (why would they go that low anyway) so I can't download apps... I put in an external 32GB microSD but that barely works :')

Exactly.. Well, I kinda knew the iPhones would not win a great reward.. Well, actually I was a Android user but got tired of it, so i decided to switch to iPhone... But the thing that actually triggered me:

OnePlus 6t.

Every time I look up smartphones I CAN?ï¿½?T scroll down without the 6t being mentioned, It was literally the next Fortnite. And when I found out that it was SOTY..? Oooohohoho.. Things went downhill. My inner self was TRIGGERED. Like... e x c U s E   m E   w H a T   t H e-

UgyHQln5QoEN00Rw8q14AaABAg.8p2HrYreAiR8p2PAYOaNOy,1 month ago,I'm not sure between the 6 and the 6T.  Is it better the fingerprint reader onscreen or is better at the back? and for those who have phones without headphone jack.. is it worth it?
UgyHQln5QoEN00Rw8q14AaABAg.8p2HrYreAiR8p2QjKj_VPZ,1 month ago,"@P??rez Q Personal preference. I like the snappiness of the on back fingerprint scanner.  As soon as I pick up my phone and touch the scanner on the back, the phone INSTANTLY turns on before I even look at the screen. Also, my fingers naturally gravitate towards that position on the back. There's also fingerprint gestures you can use on the OnePlus 6 that isn't available on the 6T. However, I don't use them at all. 

I think onscreen fingerprint scanner is pointless given how blazingly fast OnePlus's face ID is. As soon as I touch the power button or double tap the screen to wake the device, I'm already in the phone. ????????

In summary, the OnePlus 6's rear fingerprint scanner is my most prefered given I can quickly get into my phone in any position, whether that means the device is face down or face up. 

However, what made me not upgrade to the 6T wasn't the fingerprint scanner but the lack of a headphone jack. Even though I own a Sony WH-1000XM3, I like the flexibility to plug in when the BT headphone's battery dies. 

Again, it's all personal preference. You can't go wrong with either."

I'd say if you want bleeding-edge the and want to try the in screen fingerprint scanner and don't mind that it doesn't have headphone jack get the 6t.
 but if you would like a headphone jack and would prefer a faster physical fingerprint reader then get the normal 6.

I look at them as more like two sides of the same coin versus one thing replaced  the other. 

 having used the on-screen fingerprint scanner sometimes it does misread but it's not often enough that it really bothers me and personally I just think it's cool. but everything else is top-notch the phone is faster as long battery life it looks good.

 it's a OnePlus phone basically."

I switched from iPhone to Note 9 this year as my personal phone and I am not regretting my decision.  I find myself on my phone much more since getting the Note 9.  I use the split screen often while watching football, and following the game on Twitter.  S-Pen is one of those things that you are cool without, until you are using it all of the time at work.  If you are considering the Note 9, I fully endorse this product.  Yes, it is expensive, but you get a more for the more you spend, as with most things in life."

I am officially unsubbing from your biased content that makes no sense. Last year you picked Note 8 as MVP yet you never used it. This year you're picking MVP phone that's not even sold in retailers, and it's a phone that doesn't compete with top guys, yet you use Pixel 3XL. You're a joke now, your content has zero credibility. It's a shame, because you were at one point the best reviewer on the planet. As soon as you became famous, you signed all these sponsor deals, you started taking bribes lol. Shame on you!!!!!"
UgwrGKt5oxrMYDkTGkZ4AaABAg,1 month ago,"I have a pretty good question for you. Only because you shown in the past you have shown, you like two different phones. I have been waiting for almost a year for the pixel 3 to come out. Previously I have been a note (3,5,7,8) person. so when the opportunity came to buy the note 9. I turned it down. Cuz I was waiting on the pixel 3. Unfortunately I have only heard nothing but bad comments about the pixel 3. And since I have to work hard for my money. Would you still recommend the pixel 3? Or go for the note 9? Only because, I'm not looking at buying another phone for at least two years. And I run my business off my phone. I am a barber.
 Thank you for taking the time to read this. And responding. ???????? High rated for the third time. And I thought I did not give you clarity on my usage of a phone. 100% of the time I use voice to text. Like I'm using it right now. I take a lot of photos off my phone. Especially to show off my barber work. On Instagram under Charlesthebarber1. I also write papers off my phone. I also, do biblical detailed studies off my phone. So I'm not the average guy who just makes phone calls and sends emails. T-Mobile told me, I had over a hundred and twenty two apps on my phone. I expect my phone to make my life easier not harder. I work the snot out of my phone! So what you recommend will mean a lot.  Sorry this is so long. I just wanted you to be able to walk a mile in my shoes."

UgzUTJAtg1YdDbZYQjN4AaABAg,1 month ago,"Forget about the headphone jack, it will be completely gone in like 2 years when Samsung finally gets rid of it, by then the majority of people will be using wireless, well probably by the end of next year most people will be using wireless earphones and such. This shouldn't be considered a reason to give a phone an award ( I know the note 9 got the award for many other things) but the headphone jack shouldn't be one of them."
UgzUTJAtg1YdDbZYQjN4AaABAg.8p28jZQBf9m8p2D97fbALk,1 month ago,"You're misinformed. The headphone jack isn't dead. Only phones are tryign to remove them, and it's not because of 'bravery' or because they're embracing 'the future of technology' or whatever other marketing bullshit you've been sold, it's because these companies sell bluetooth headphones. They'd love for you to buy a phone from them, and also buy some headphones. They want you in their eco system. Wireless is only superior in comfort. 
As a consumer, you're a fool to advocate for less choice for yourself."

A compact phone is one where a user can reach every part of the screen without shifting their grip, and for my medium-small hands that demands a body about the size of the XZ1C?ï¿½? 5""??2.6"" (129mm??65mm). Even with all the aspect ratio and notch stuff, the Pixel 3 is still 5.73""??2.69"" (146mm??68mm) and the iPhone XS is 5.65""??2.79"" (144mm??2.79mm), demanding almost another inch of reach.

Now, if you want to call the size of  these two devices medium or standard or regular, that's fine, but calling them compact 1) does not fall in line with branding, 2) does not reflect reality, 3) does not meet user expectation, and 4) deals an immense disservice to consumers of a phone category that no-one seems to want to build flagships for. Next year, have a compact group for phones <= 5"" effective size (including the screen and one side of the bezel since you only interact with one while one-handing), a big group for phones >= 6"" effective size, a mid-size group for everything else.

While the on-screen fingerprint is very cool, i prefer the one in the back for that extra handiness and snappiness (hardly noticeable though) and the audio jack. With the fingerprint sensor on the back, i can actually add functionality to bind it to the notification pull down. Personally, i do not regret at all going for the 6 instead of the 6t"

(and no im not willing to carry a bulky external dac/amp with me)
A phone with proper audio components like the last iphones with a headphone jack or the latest lg and oneplus phones will always sound better.

UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg,1 month ago,Giving the smartphone of the year to OnePlus 6t doesn't make sense. Sure it is so great for it's price and you could have given it the budget phone award. You shouldn't be considering price while choosing The Best Phone just like you didn't consider price for say the best camera phone . It should be given to the absolute best phone irrespective of the price for people who can afford it .  It looks like you wanted to satisfy all the fanboys by giving a award for each major company
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p28J0dUoRu,1 month ago,Dinesh Kumar Totally agree. He should have chosen Note 9 / Mate 20 pro / Iphone Xs max.
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p299NaRCrZ,1 month ago,Smartphone of the year means ALL aspects of the phone should be on point. OP 6t as said in the video is pretty good in all possible ways as well as the price. You can't just check off one of the criteria and say we shouldn't consider it. For me this award makes sense as the phone is literally amazing at everything.
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p29odCACVM,1 month ago,Egozit But something like lets say the note 9 is better in EVERYTHING. Its not like the note 9 has something very horrible that makes it not receive mvp. The 6t is meh - good at everything but that still doesnt make it mvp as phones like mate 20 pro or note 9 Xs max are amazing in everything.

UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2AkFiBDTM,1 month ago,@Marko Veljanovski $600 is flagship anything over $400 to me is flagship prices budget $0-$200 midrange $201-$402
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2BVb8l12c,1 month ago,"I guess you're right to an extent, but the OnePlus is better in many ways too. Such as, better HDR, faster speed, faster updates, arguably better design, faster charging etc. This is coming from an s9+ user."
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2Bw_tUzdS,1 month ago,"Atif Ghafoor Still,  you cant consider price in an mvp award. He should have 2 different budget awards idk... But a phone like the 6t should for sure not be categorized as THE BEST phone of 2019 because its no where near the best."
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2CD-mOiQt,1 month ago,"@MetalPhoenix45 my argument was not the features it was the cost they did used to be midrange when it was $400 with the 3t the year the one plus 3 and 3t where head to head with the axon 7 as big mid range phone but each year they have bumped prices up.
Personally I don't use all the features of a note 9 or one plus 6 to say the price is worth it but if you will use all the features then yes it is.
I just need a device that can play my games and last me a long time between charges so I go for 600 series phones with a 5000 mah battery."

UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2DyiYN6YU,1 month ago,Rejoice Yadli The mvp isn't the normal person phone though. It is the mvp award the best phone of 2019 and it has nothing to do with price. And oneplus 6t is for sure not the best phone you can buy right now.
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2EHLvnLcx,1 month ago,"@Marko Veljanovski Well the Note 9 is steeply priced, although packed with features, same goes for the XS Max, overall a good phone all things is done well, but the price is steep, so it makes total sense the 6T won. I've got both the 6T and XS Max and both are amazing."
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2ElRhKuNg,1 month ago,"@Marko Veljanovski I get it, and what you say makes sense but I think what went to this as well for him seems to be the phone he just enjoys the most. He's always really disliked the Samsung software experience, and if you put the OnePlus OS on the note, I think that would be his winner. He talked about switching from his long time favorite of the pixel to the OnePlus, and I think there's just a lot OnePlus offers as an overall mvp. They've steadily improved in a lot of qualities and now offer 2 years of software support for all their phones. I think factors like that matter and contribute to why he may prefer the OP6T over the note."
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2F3loBA6_,1 month ago,"lets be honest..we all expecting it will be either mate 20 pro or note9.but considering his biased review of the mate 20 pro i was expecting the award goes to note9..which is also perfect i guess?but oneplus 6t??what? its not even cheap,have crap camera,so so battery,the only argument is the OS which is subjectively depends on preference. yeah! i agreed he tried to pleased all fanboy."

They intentionally don?ï¿½?t put certain features into their smartphone like Ip67/68 water resistance, stereo speakers,etc because they want to launch a whole new model phone just based on one of the above features. The next phone(7) will have one additional feature, the next(7t) will have another additional and so on. They are pure corporate and are second to only Apple in terms of fooling customers. OnePlus 6T honestly didn?ï¿½?t deserve the award! Note 9 or Mate 20 Pro or iPhone Xs Max are better conte"

I get that the OP6T is faster but not enough to make it better than the Note 9. Samsung software got a lot better to the point where I don't miss being on Oxygen OS. Also the in screen fingerprint sensor is cool but not as dope as having an S-Pen if you ask me.
And the price? You can get an unlocked Note 9 for 700 bucks.

Here's my point : OP6T is a great phone (and one of my fav manufacturers), but the competition in the top of the line smartphone range is so brutal, that it is very hard to recommend a OP6 or 6T over a Note 9 or an S9 or a Pixel 3 non XL.

Moreover, the OP has lost some of its ground due to the introduction of Poco F1.

Their brand is, we'll sell you a phone which is almost as good as a flagship, for a little less money than a flagship. That's the definition of settling. Oneplus (oppo) dosen't care about their ""enthusiast"" audience. It's just a way for the biggest chinese phone company to expand into western markets."

UgzYfNxk4pJWoc9jkY94AaABAg.8p1zxNV6mcJ8p28ZyPE6Id,1 month ago,"It's the best because it's the most balanced. For me, it's useless to have the best camera if the design sucks, to have the best design but a not so good battery life, or even to have good battery and camera but shitty, never updating and bloated software. Those are only hypotetical examples, I'm not speaking about any real device.

OnePlus 6T is the most balanced phone, not the absolute best in any category, but really good and high ranked in all of them. That makes it, regardless of the price, the best phone overall. I'm not on a budget and I could buy the Mate 20 Pro or the Note 9, but honestly... I simply prefer the OnePlus 6T, it's much more appealing for me."

UgzYfNxk4pJWoc9jkY94AaABAg.8p1zxNV6mcJ8p35bc1yhKQ,1 month ago,"@JOSE CARLOS CESPEDES Z. Again, it's the most balanced phone, that's objective. There is no phone which is the absolute best in all categories, but OP6T is very good in all of them.That's really valuable for the average customer. I feel like I'm repeating myself, but you do look like you don't wanna understand: Being the best in one or two categories doesn't make a phone the best overall, another phone can be a little under that device in those two categories, but overall, as it is better balanced in the rest, be better for the average customer as a daily driver. 

Anyway, don't know what's the point of discussing this... These are the MKBHD Awards, he's the only juror, his opinion is the only thing it matters and... Do you know what?? He probably knows best cause he tested more phones than both you and me together and has 7.5 M subscribers for a reason."

From the extremely poor camera performance, to the remarkably slow fingerprint sensor, I don't think I'd ever recommend the phone to anyone. It'd be easier to list just the good qualities it has, and that's easy because it's just two of them. The price and the battery. The 3700 mAh battery is durable and can sustain even the worst gaming habits.

I can name at least 3 phones having capacities of 5000mAh. How the hell does Red Hydrogen One gets an honorable mention here, huh? The phone has got nothing special, compared to other flagships and if someone really wants to buy a phone with a great battery and takes this video as a judgment, he would be cheated for sure! This is the most terrible video I have watched from you, MKBHD and as a fan, I'm angry! Jonathan keeps being an iSheep and you're turning into a RedSheep! Good luck!

PS: Why spend $1200 on a shitty phone, even it has a better battery than most flagships? Leave even the iPhone XR or Huawei Mate 20 Pro. Even Pocophone F1 could be a really good choice or even phones from ASUS would be fine, where you spend $300 and spend $749 on an iPhone XR, and even after that, you will have enough money to book an Uber to go home!"

Too big to be considered a normal phone and to hold it like a normal person in your hand, but too small to be considered a tablet.

UgwJXUGkyZF98mXqVkZ4AaABAg,1 month ago,"(((((((DEMONS)))))))

Demons are another name for fallen angels who joined the kingdom of Satan in rebellion against God.

The origin of demons is not explicitly discussed in the bible. But the New Testament speaks of the fall and later imprisonment of a group of angels (1 Peter. 3:19-20; 2 Peter. 2:4; Jude 6). The group that participated in the fall apparently followed one of their own number, Satan. The fall occurred before God's creation of the world. In retaliatory hatred for God, Satan and his angels tirelessly seek to contaminate the human race with wickedness (Genesis. 3; Matthew. 25:41; Revelation. 12:9).

A symbolic view of this ""initial"" fall appears in Revelation 12:4 where the dragon (A symbol of Satan) ""drew a third of the stars of heaven"" (A symbol for fallen angels) and ""threw them to the earth."" Thus Satan has his own ""angels,"" who most students see as the demons of this era (Matthew 25:41; Revelation 12:9).

Because the Jews believed God's power was unlimited, the Old Testament contains little information about demons. The primitive status of the understanding of demons during this time is perhaps reflected in the way the Old Testament relates the fallen angels to God. It was a ""distressing [Or evil] spirit from God"" (Samuel 16:15-16 & 23) that brought great distress to Saul the king. It was a ""lying spirit"" from the Lord about whom Micaiah, the prophet of the Lord, spoke (1 King 22:21-23). In short, this is not to say God willed, but rather allowed the evil spirit to do its work.

The Bible reveals also that all pagan worship is a fountainhead of demon activity (Leviticus 17:7; Psalms 106:37). Demon function with greater freedom to work their bondage wherever human activities open to their ""worship""---that is, participate in carnal activities that disobey God's word, indulge the flesh, and cooperate with hell's agenda of sin, and self indulgence.??
(These sinful activities we engage ourselves in, gives the demons the authority to come into our vessels and cause turmoil in our lives. And Jesus uses these demons to try and make us use our freewill to seek him with all of our heart, soul, mind and strength).??
(Jesus): As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent. (Revelation 3:19).

The New Testament accepts the Old Testament teaching about Evil Spirits and advances the doctrine significantly. Demons are designated in a number of different ways in the New Testament. They are called ""Unclean Spirits"" (Matthew 10:1; Mark 6:7), ""Evil Spirits"" (Luke 7:21; Acts 19:12-13), ""Deceiving Spirits"" (1 Timothy 4:1), and a ""Spirit of Error"" (1 John 4:6).

The Bible warns against occult involvements, showing demon activity proliferates in such an evil spiritual environment. Luke describes one demon as a ""Spirit of Divination"" (Acts 16:16). Isaiah 8:19-22 and 47:9-15 clearly reinforce the danger-avoiding direction of Leviticus 17:7, in the spirit of the truth inherent in Deuteronomy 18:9-14 and 32:15-18. Paul clearly held this understanding (1 Corinthians 10:20-21) and warns against believers conceding any territory in their souls to the devil or his cohorts (Ephesians 4:25-32, see Verse 27).

A prime purpose of Jesus earthly ministry was to overcome the power of Satan. This included his conquest of the demonic realm (Matthew 12:25-29; Luke 11:17-22; John 12:31; 1 John 3:8). This explains the fierce conflict between Jesus and these evil spirits while he was on earth, and why Jesus promises his people---The Redeemed---authority over and power to cast out demons (Matthew 10:8; Mark 16:17).

Following the resurrection of Jesus and his return to heaven, these demonic principalities and powers have continued their warfare against those who are his followers (Roman 8:38-39; Ephesians 6:12). Yet Satan and his allies will finally be overthrown by God. After Christ returns, the devil and his angels will be defeated and thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone (Matthew 25:41; Revelation 20:10).??
This is a doom with which demons are quite familiar (Matthew 8:29).??
God will achieve the ultimate victory in this conflict which has been going on since the beginning of time."

I have been on that side, but having so many flagships made me learn how to look for a phone and how much I should pay for what i get. So no, not worth to buying a phone for 1000??? if there are another phones that do the same for a cheaper price and they are still good quality. And talking about Samsung they don't update their phones as they should. So giving 1000??? for a phone I would not buy the note9 I would prefer an iPhone, it has updates for 4 years. And I could keep going because I might be older than you are. My first flagship was a Motorola the size of a brick and a screen smaller than a human finger.

You actually have to pay another 90 bucks for it. And if you get it, your phone is still charging much slower than any Android Flagship for less money. So go ahead, pay Apple 1500 dollars for a smartphone that has no headphone jack, no fast charging out of the box, no extra featutes over older iphones. The software may be nice, but it got boring over time. You can't customize it, and you basically get the same experience when you get an iphone 6.

So, Note 9 has a jack, fast charger, it could even be the best camera due to the fact that you can install the google camera, consider even the Manual mode, something good and useful. So Iphone doesn't have a fast charger, and it hasn't the universal usb type C. Even if Iphones have more updates, doesn't mean that they're better, there is not too much difference between them and even if a Note 9 won't be updated for 4 years it will have for sure more useful things like multitasking up to 2 or more apps, Samsung Dex, edge functions, AOD, changing screen res is useful, and generally a lot of options are given from the Software, and this happened in the past too. Note 9 also has expandable storage, i agree that Iphones have the best optimization and a more powerful chip but the OS is closed so you can't really use the chip, you can't install any apk or emulator, ps1, ps2, psp and so on."

And yes between iPhones and Samsung's I prefer iPhone, it is not only because of the updates. I am a tech enthusiast, not a fanboy. You clearly don't get the point. It's like me as a car tuner, I don't look for a car with heated seats, or little insonorisation. I rather have a bigger turbo, get it now? All those features you are talking about, most people do not even use them. Emulators, if you are a true gamer you will go for a console or a gaming pc. If you want to use two apps at the same time you use that on an iPad or a surfacebook,. Dex is a quite useful feature, but for me it is not, I always carry my mbp with me. Expandable storage it can be useful, but most phones have 128gb internal, that's enough I guess... The old jack... Well the old jack, I am not a world class musician so I am alright with my 3 pairs of wireless earphones/headphones, and I do own some type c earphones as well.

OnePlus 6t.

UgyHQln5QoEN00Rw8q14AaABAg.8p2HrYreAiR8p2PAYOaNOy,1 month ago,I'm not sure between the 6 and the 6T.  Is it better the fingerprint reader onscreen or is better at the back? and for those who have phones without headphone jack.. is it worth it?
UgyHQln5QoEN00Rw8q14AaABAg.8p2HrYreAiR8p2QjKj_VPZ,1 month ago,"@P??rez Q Personal preference. I like the snappiness of the on back fingerprint scanner.  As soon as I pick up my phone and touch the scanner on the back, the phone INSTANTLY turns on before I even look at the screen. Also, my fingers naturally gravitate towards that position on the back. There's also fingerprint gestures you can use on the OnePlus 6 that isn't available on the 6T. However, I don't use them at all. 

I think onscreen fingerprint scanner is pointless given how blazingly fast OnePlus's face ID is. As soon as I touch the power button or double tap the screen to wake the device, I'm already in the phone. ????????

In summary, the OnePlus 6's rear fingerprint scanner is my most prefered given I can quickly get into my phone in any position, whether that means the device is face down or face up. 

However, what made me not upgrade to the 6T wasn't the fingerprint scanner but the lack of a headphone jack. Even though I own a Sony WH-1000XM3, I like the flexibility to plug in when the BT headphone's battery dies. 

Again, it's all personal preference. You can't go wrong with either."

I'd say if you want bleeding-edge the and want to try the in screen fingerprint scanner and don't mind that it doesn't have headphone jack get the 6t.
 but if you would like a headphone jack and would prefer a faster physical fingerprint reader then get the normal 6.

I look at them as more like two sides of the same coin versus one thing replaced  the other. 

 having used the on-screen fingerprint scanner sometimes it does misread but it's not often enough that it really bothers me and personally I just think it's cool. but everything else is top-notch the phone is faster as long battery life it looks good.

 it's a OnePlus phone basically."

UgwrGKt5oxrMYDkTGkZ4AaABAg,1 month ago,"I have a pretty good question for you. Only because you shown in the past you have shown, you like two different phones. I have been waiting for almost a year for the pixel 3 to come out. Previously I have been a note (3,5,7,8) person. so when the opportunity came to buy the note 9. I turned it down. Cuz I was waiting on the pixel 3. Unfortunately I have only heard nothing but bad comments about the pixel 3. And since I have to work hard for my money. Would you still recommend the pixel 3? Or go for the note 9? Only because, I'm not looking at buying another phone for at least two years. And I run my business off my phone. I am a barber.
 Thank you for taking the time to read this. And responding. ???????? High rated for the third time. And I thought I did not give you clarity on my usage of a phone. 100% of the time I use voice to text. Like I'm using it right now. I take a lot of photos off my phone. Especially to show off my barber work. On Instagram under Charlesthebarber1. I also write papers off my phone. I also, do biblical detailed studies off my phone. So I'm not the average guy who just makes phone calls and sends emails. T-Mobile told me, I had over a hundred and twenty two apps on my phone. I expect my phone to make my life easier not harder. I work the snot out of my phone! So what you recommend will mean a lot.  Sorry this is so long. I just wanted you to be able to walk a mile in my shoes."

Only phones are tryign to remove them, and it's not because of 'bravery' or because they're embracing 'the future of technology' or whatever other marketing bullshit you've been sold, it's because these companies sell bluetooth headphones. They'd love for you to buy a phone from them, and also buy some headphones. They want you in their eco system. Wireless is only superior in comfort.

A compact phone is one where a user can reach every part of the screen without shifting their grip, and for my medium-small hands that demands a body about the size of the XZ1C?ï¿½? 5""??2.6"" (129mm??65mm). Even with all the aspect ratio and notch stuff, the Pixel 3 is still 5.73""??2.69"" (146mm??68mm) and the iPhone XS is 5.65""??2.79"" (144mm??2.79mm), demanding almost another inch of reach.

Now, if you want to call the size of  these two devices medium or standard or regular, that's fine, but calling them compact 1) does not fall in line with branding, 2) does not reflect reality, 3) does not meet user expectation, and 4) deals an immense disservice to consumers of a phone category that no-one seems to want to build flagships for. Next year, have a compact group for phones <= 5"" effective size (including the screen and one side of the bezel since you only interact with one while one-handing), a big group for phones >= 6"" effective size, a mid-size group for everything else. Please."

While the on-screen fingerprint is very cool, i prefer the one in the back for that extra handiness and snappiness (hardly noticeable though) and the audio jack. With the fingerprint sensor on the back, i can actually add functionality to bind it to the notification pull down. Personally, i do not regret at all going for the 6 instead of the 6t"

The issue I would think of isn't related to the phone hard/software at all rather than the support of OnePlus itself when it comes to damages and warranty."

(and no im not willing to carry a bulky external dac/amp with me)
A phone with proper audio components like the last iphones with a headphone jack or the latest lg and oneplus phones will always sound better.
And again, id want multiple inexpensive passive 1??? adapters on all of my 3.5mm headphones, not a single 20??? dac dongle always with me on the go that im likely to loose"

UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg,1 month ago,Giving the smartphone of the year to OnePlus 6t doesn't make sense. Sure it is so great for it's price and you could have given it the budget phone award. You shouldn't be considering price while choosing The Best Phone just like you didn't consider price for say the best camera phone . It should be given to the absolute best phone irrespective of the price for people who can afford it .  It looks like you wanted to satisfy all the fanboys by giving a award for each major company
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p28J0dUoRu,1 month ago,Dinesh Kumar Totally agree. He should have chosen Note 9 / Mate 20 pro / Iphone Xs max.
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p299NaRCrZ,1 month ago,Smartphone of the year means ALL aspects of the phone should be on point.

Personally I don't use all the features of a note 9 or one plus 6 to say the price is worth it but if you will use all the features then yes it is.
I just need a device that can play my games and last me a long time between charges so I go for 600 series phones with a 5000 mah battery."

UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2DyiYN6YU,1 month ago,Rejoice Yadli The mvp isn't the normal person phone though. It is the mvp award the best phone of 2019 and it has nothing to do with price. And oneplus 6t is for sure not the best phone you can buy right now.
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2EHLvnLcx,1 month ago,"@Marko Veljanovski Well the Note 9 is steeply priced, although packed with features, same goes for the XS Max, overall a good phone all things is done well, but the price is steep, so it makes total sense the 6T won. I've got both the 6T and XS Max and both are amazing."
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2ElRhKuNg,1 month ago,"@Marko Veljanovski I get it, and what you say makes sense but I think what went to this as well for him seems to be the phone he just enjoys the most. He's always really disliked the Samsung software experience, and if you put the OnePlus OS on the note, I think that would be his winner. He talked about switching from his long time favorite of the pixel to the OnePlus, and I think there's just a lot OnePlus offers as an overall mvp. They've steadily improved in a lot of qualities and now offer 2 years of software support for all their phones. I think factors like that matter and contribute to why he may prefer the OP6T over the note."
UgzJCq9IMV4O4uhjPOt4AaABAg.8p24fV3p8eg8p2F3loBA6_,1 month ago,"lets be honest..we all expecting it will be either mate 20 pro or note9.but considering his biased review of the mate 20 pro i was expecting the award goes to note9..which is also perfect i guess?but oneplus 6t??what? its not even cheap,have crap camera,so so battery,the only argument is the OS which is subjectively depends on preference. yeah! i agreed he tried to pleased all fanboy."
