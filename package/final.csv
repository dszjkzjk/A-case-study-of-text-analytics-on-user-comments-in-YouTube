Funny you mention the notch though. Because everyone, and I mean everyone started copying it after it showed up on the iPhone. And as far as the screen goes, it may have a similar ppi as the iPhone 5, but again, numbers are numbers, and facts are facts...the XR display isnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t an iPhone 5 display. Most people(as per many YouTube videos) actually pick the XR display over many OLED displays in blind tests. But again, IPhones arenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t for everyone, but donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t hate them just for the sake of hating them. Every other brand has just as long a list of negatives for some people. Use what you like, but donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t try and tell someone else what they think. Everyone has their own opinions and views. Their is enough tech for everyone!

But of course apple is apple like to overprice and ask money for every single thing and of course the top price. And what i did not mention is they use samsung and lg parts like display so you can't say iphone display is better than other android manufacturers because they don't have they own displays. So they take lg display but after fitting inside of iphone they ask 2x as more where is the logic. They use old tehnologies and calling them innovation. And yes Samsung don't copy apple they never get rid off headphone jack and don't have annoying notch. Samsung is really makeing improvements and listen what people want . You will see S10 will be the most bought smartphone of the year because samsung knows what means innovation.,0

I left out the Pixel while though it has a good camera (way overhyped, it's not as great as some say it is) it's otherwise an overpriced, ugly, low spec phone, 4gb ram on a 2018 flagship isn't acceptable and it's terrible ram management proves that.

Why? Because you bought a flaghsip. Duh. You won't mind spending extra money on a good wireless headphones, right? Just sayin. I expect rude replies tho :)

My Dads new company bought him a note 9 for testing, and on top of his Personal XS MAX, theyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re both pretty amazing. So yeah, next itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s gonna be interesting to say the least for smartphones.

 I'm aware of this hon. Thank you. What I'm searching for is high-quality, sound.
 Unfortunately, not all phones have this feature. 
Plus, it's about time for an upgrade. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
Too many phones to choose from out there. I've been doing my research and read through many, many, reviews. 
I found that the majority of consumers prefer the Samsung S6 to the S9. They also claim the sound is much cleaner and louder. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
I figured I'd ask for recommendations and any help I can get here. 
 I know there are many of you that are brilliant with technology.

That is a phone that most compare with the note 9 and i think most  undoubtedly beat the s9 and s9+ in performance. Though not the note 9. its debatable if the note9 is worth 300 more then the  v40 . I bought the LG 7 because at 500.00  I think its a better value then the One plus 6T and the S9. One. 500.00 Two. quad DAC. Three. screen is much better the the 6T  plus it has wireless charging. 4 Warranty two years instead of one. Not to mention military grade drop testing and IP 68 waterproof.  If the S9  was the same cost as the LG G7  I would go with the S9 , BUT the 6t at 580.00 naw",0

They will happily promote a status quo device with all of its problems over a more functional and higher productivity device. This is why I prefer Mr. Mobile and Juan Bagnell.

Got mine for $450 on project fi, has a lot of the things I was looking for. SD chad/headphone jack/wireless charging/hd screen/water+dust resistance/wide angle camera/quad dac. Only thing I would wish they did different was it came with the latest version of android and they put a bigger battery in there but its not really a big of a deal to me as I rarely use my phone at work when im out or stream videos.  Did love the note 9 camera though, havent gotten a chance to mess around with a pixel yet but I have the gcam installed on my g7 and it does take better pictures than the stock camera.

I toyed with the S9, S9+, and Note 9 this past Sunday at a Sams Club store and enjoyed the screen quality as well as the vibrancy in color. All three of them did exceedingly well in that aspect. The camera does need improvement especially with the color balance (it made the palm of my hand look almost hot pink even though it was much closer to a white person's skin tone than it was pink). I was also hoping to watch videos in full infinity screen but the video was trimmed to where it looked like an S7 edge. I also wanted to use the s pen but the device must've been on such a lock down that the pen couldn't be taken out. I'm hoping for a step up on the camera next year.",0

""That's the fastest android phone right now""
It is the fastest but it isn't the smoothest. Android is always most optimised for Snapdragon processors. The Kirin 980 might be the best in benchmarks and speed tests but just trying out the demos on in the stores, I can tell that it is not as smooth as the S845 phones. It might not be obvious in app animations because they are speed up so fast by Huawei but just try out scrolling on Chrome, it drops more frames than the 6t or 3xl from what I see. Go theverge.com (mobile site) on your Mate 20 Pro and try scrolling. Compare the experience to any Android phones with S845 or iPhone 8/X/Xs/Xr/Xs Max. The Pixel 3xl might sucks in ram management and benchmarks but Google always manage to bring the smoothest (Not fastest) Android experience to their phones. 

""the gestures are awesome""
It is really awful on the Mate 20 Pro. I like how it tries to follow the iPhone's gestures but the software is just too horrible. Huawei has great hardware engineers but their software is so bad. Just the basic swipe up gesture don't works well if you are in a full screen scrollable content app like Chrome. Swiping up to go back to home sometimes will just ends up scrolling up in the app instead. OnePlus 6t however has no problems with that. Huawei or simply all Android manufacturers should just leave the software to Google by providing a close to stock Android experience.",0

You guys/girls always fail to mention that. Even with the Apple watch, that even has an LG screen. So Samsung actually has the best smart phone out with the S9+/Note 9 hands down. Only the XR (Liquid Retina - LCD) is a 100% Apple product which is subpar. SuperSafTv, you gotta give Samsung it's credit bruh. Real tech heads know what's up! C'mon bro! ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï",0

Reasons....
1. Very good Battery life and also really fast charging.
2. One of the best software optimized phones out there.
3. The Speed of the overall phone is excellent.
4. For the price its the best i can think of.
5. Camera is decent but not that good. (Still ok for me).
5. Can be rooted very easily.
6. Lots of updates and bug fixes always (really good community)



But.... If the mate 20 pro didn't have that curved display i would've taken that as my top pick.  Also the mate 20 pro cant be rooted ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.

UgyMD-GvhpU3Yupmxo54AaABAg,Tariq Ahmed,2 months ago,1.54448E+12,"Huawei is the most annoying phone there is. It feels like you have a Samsung in the way it operates but even worse. 

Samsung has too much bs built in it and both Samsung and Huawei fail in my most important aspect; user experience. 

Pixels camera is good, video not so much (specially audio quality) and with their new gesture system and that swimming pool of a notch, and because they track everything about you and share with, or sell it to their advertisers I just wouldn't buy it (although I planned to). 

The razer 2 has an amazing refresh rate that is the smoothest of any, but unfortunately they get updates late , their camera is sub-par and their battery life rubbish not to mention you can't see the screen outdoors because it has poor brightness. 

One plus 6t is a great value for money because it does everything well enough. It's user experience is absolutely wonderful to see. I'm just waiting on them to move onto a higher screen to body ratio and I'll definitely buy it when it does just that. Possibly next year. 

Also the mi mix 3 intrigued me. Maybe the next generation.

I have an S9 too, and it has been a stellar phone since I bought it around launch!

The only real criticism I have to give for it is that I wish that it had a bigger battery. I was kinda disappointed that Samsung cancelled the S9 Active because I would have probably gone for that to have the 4,000mah battery, but I'd much rather have the standard S9 because I can't do larger phones like the S9 Plus/Note 9.",0
UgydAizIzx7AmyFrQNB4AaABAg.8ntOo9zmjyo8oNHBKFyXXq,Chandler Burns,2 months ago,1.54448E+12,"@Mexicana Loca Justin Bieber Oreo Yeah, I have the standard S9, which has only 4GB of ram (the S9+ has 6GB). However, 4GB is honestly fine for a phone of that size, the screen is easily the best on any smartphone available, and the cameras on Samsung devices are second-best behind Google (Google's hardware has nothing on Samsung's in the end though). I only wish that the S9 maybe had something like a 3300-3500mah battery instead of a 3000mah. The S9+ would be better suited with say a 3700mah like in the OnePlus 6T. But that again is why I wish Samsung had made an S9 Active, because it's not really the bulky and sturdy build I care about but rather the sheer beast of battery life the Active series has been known for.",0

I also feel like a phone the size of the standard S9 with 4GB of ram and a 4000mah battery would have given the Note 9 a hard time considering it would have been around $800 like the S8 Active was before it. It's such a shame that it happened in the end, the Active line has such a huge following, heck both my parents have S8 Actives.",0

Yes the mate 20 pro has a very good camera in terms of sharpness, zoom and macro, but when it comes to accuracy and the latter it fails, especially on video mode where it tries to stabilize the phone as much as possible and it ended up with a horrible artificial stablization. Screen. The only part where i see the mate 20 leading in that factor is its curved screen. The iPhone XS MAX has a super amoled folded screen for a chinless design while the Mate 20 has a regular OLED. I agree that it is full of features, but it is also filled with gimmicks especially with the reverse wireless charging where reports have said that it is slow and quickly heats up the Mate 20.",2

UgxQH_-DiHU_PT3CNcJ4AaABAg.8nt1IXySZTW8o1sNYGc4cf,Ivorocious,2 months ago,1.54448E+12,@Max`s Account huashit sheep. Those are reviews. Not speedtests. And if you want speed then it is only present on the CPU but it lags behind on GPU. Of course. Opinions doesnt change facts because after all it is an opinion like how you said the iPhone is very ugly which is a big opinion. In my own personal list i put the iPhone XS MAX in the first place and it 100% doesnt hurt anyone unless you want everyone to put your fave phone to the top of every list. I am not embarassing myself because i am defending my opinions not attacking others opinion.  For me the notch of the iPhone X series gives the phone a character that differentiates itself from others and i think it look beautiful as it is also pro-function rather than pro-design. Same thing can be said to samsungs curved display. Huawei did nothing original but just merged both apple and samsungs character.,1

The Benz of course because after 30 miles of running at high speed you still have some juice to run you for another 30, not like an iPhone, no disrespect, but after 2 years of abuse, all you get after spending so much, is a throttled battery and another version of iOS that simply confuse instead of amaze.

I can't name one thing that I would want on my iPhone 8 that I would use all the time. Headphone jack isn't important and almost all companies such as Google and LG got rid of the Headphone jack also.,0

I think, the best phone does note have to be the best at everything but it must be ""near"" perfect at ""everything"". So Mate 20 Pro has better battery performance and a bit better camera performance. So It narrowing ""doubltless best"" thanks to these. 20pro and  xsmax are challenging on camera, speed etc. But battery is takes 20pro to best smartphone of 2018.

Since I have only used one of the current phones (my Note 9) there is no way for me to make up a list of phones when I've only heard about the others through tech reviewers like you. Is it the top five that look the coolest? The top five that tech reviewers seemed to favor. Specs don't always translate to real world performance. A better question would be, what features would your ideal phone include out of the features that became available in the 2018 smart phone world. If that were the question, then my list would be (in no particular order):
1. 4000+ mAh battery
2. In screen fingerprint sensor

LTT did a poll and the XS won by a lot because of its insane HDR. It is not as true to life. I personally like the Pixel 3 just because it's truer to life. The iPhones have the best video camera, it's not up for debate. Googles tracking focus thing is gimmicky, takes too much processing power, and if it worked perfectly, it still would be complete BS unless the sensor was large enough to actually get a good depth of field. Even other phones that do 4k 60 pail in comparison to the XS. If you disagree then watch camera reviews and go to the video section or watch iPhone XS reviews. I agree with all your other statements, but there is a huge difference in video and camera with iPhone XS winning in video and iPhone XS, Note 9, or Pixel 3. Most people say the Pixel 3 w/o actually seeing it just because it is the popular choice. Jusmember the iPhone XS makes the most pleasing to the eyes photo and best photo for people who didn't see what you say, whereas the Note 9 has a more punchy image, and the Pixel 3 has the most realistic image.

The XS Max has a better processor, better battery life (look at the tests Huawei's new phone is insane but not the Mate 20 Pro), better video recording, and MUCH better HDR which can make the photo look better to some people. It is all opinion, Oh, I forgot, no iOS is a deal breaker for a lot of people. It also has a better screen (the Note 9 and the iPhone too). It is all opinion.

But there are more reasons than buying a phone thats 2 Seconds faster in a game speed test. 
And I dont like the closed system of Apple (even if its very nice to use). 
The Note 9 is an allrounder. And got the pen i am so used to. But everyone has to chose itself.
However, the specs you listed are way to high. Who needs that? 8gb of ram are enough. 256 gb are enough. But on the battery I think its reaching 5k",0
