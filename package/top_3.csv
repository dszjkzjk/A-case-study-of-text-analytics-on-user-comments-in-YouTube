i get that the op6t is faster but not enough to make it better than the note 9. samsung software got a lot better to the point where i don't miss being on oxygen os. also the in screen fingerprint sensor is cool but not as dope as having an s-pen if you ask me.
and the price? you can get an unlocked note 9 for 700 bucks.
